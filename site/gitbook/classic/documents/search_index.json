Please refer to the plugin reference for more details.\n\n\n\nStart ActiveMQ from the target directory, for example:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]\\assembly\\target\nunzip activemq-x.x-SNAPSHOT.zip\ncd activemq-x.x-SNAPSHOT\nbin\\activemq\nNOTE: Working directories get created relative to the current directory. To create the working directories in the proper place, ActiveMQ must be launched from its home/installation directory.\n\nProceed to the #Testing the Installation section.\nWarning\nIf you are building ActiveMQ 4.x under Windows using Cygwin there is a path name length limitation. If the path name length is exceeded, you may see build errors. To correct this, move the ActiveMQ source directory higher in the file system tree, e.g., /cygdrive/c/d/sm.\n\n\nWindows Developer's Release\nThis procedure explains how to download and install the latest developer's snapshot.\n\nOpen the release archive: https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/(open one of the SNAPSHOT directories)\nSelect the version of ActiveMQ to download (if necessary, scroll down to see the ActiveMQ snapshots).\nExtract the files from the ZIP file into a directory of your choice.\nIf a binary snapshot was downloaded, proceed to the #Starting ActiveMQ section of this document.If a source snapshot was downloaded, perform step 6 and step 7 of the #Windows Source Installation procedure.\nFollowing start-up, proceed to the #Testing the Installation section.\n\nInstallation Procedure for Unix\nUnix Binary Installation\nThis procedure explains how to download and install the binary distribution on a Unix system.NOTE: There are several alternative ways to perform this type of installation.\n\nDownload the activemq zipped tarball file to the Unix machine, using either a browser or a tool, i.e., wget, scp, ftp, etc. for example:(see Download -> \"The latest stable release\")\nwget http://activemq.apache.org/path/tofile/apache-activemq-x.x.x-bin.tar.gz\n\nExtract the files from the zipped tarball into a directory of your choice. For example:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]\ntar zxvf activemq-x.x.x-bin.tar.gz\n\nProceed to the #Starting ActiveMQ section of this document.\n\nFollowing start-up, go to the #Testing the Installation section.\n\n\nUsing Homebrew installer on OSX\nIf you use OSX as your platform, you can use Homebrew package manager to easily install Apache ActiveMQ.\n\nAfter installing Homebrew package manager successfully, just run\n$ brew install apache-activemq\nYou can expect the following output:\n==> Downloading http://www.gossipcheck.com/mirrors/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/x.x.x/apache-activemq-x.x.x-bin.tar.gz\n################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Caveats\nSoftware was installed to:\n  /usr/local/Cellar/apache-activemq/x.x.x/libexec\n==> Summary\n/usr/local/Cellar/apache-activemq/x.x.x: 406 files, 35M, built in 2 seconds\n\n\nActiveMQ will be installed in /usr/local/Cellar/apache-activemq/x.x.x/ directory (where x.x.x denotes the actual version being installed).\nNow you can proceed to #Starting ActiveMQ and #Testing the Installation sections.\nUnix Source Installation\nThis procedure explains how to download and install the source distribution on a Unix system. This procedure assumes the Unix machine has a browser. Please see the previous #Unix Binary Installation section for details on how to install ActiveMQ without a browser.\n\nDownload the latest source release(see Download -> \"The latest stable release\" -> \"activemq-parent-x.x.x-source-release.zip\")\nExtract the files from the ZIP file into a directory of your choice. For example:\ntar zxvf activemq.x.x-src.tar.gz\n\nBuild ActiveMQ using Maven:The preferred method of building ActiveMQ is the following:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]\nmvn clean install # add \"-Dmaven.test.skip=true\" if tests are failing on your system (should not happen)\nIf Maven crashes with a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, you you need to do this first (assuming a Bourne-like shell):\nexport MAVEN_OPTS=\"-Xmx512M\"\nIf you prefer to use an IDE then you can auto-generate the IDE's project file using maven plugins:\nmvn eclipse:eclipse\nor\nmvn idea:idea\nFeel free to use any other applicable IDE. Please refer to the plugin reference for more details.NOTE: Working directories get created relative to the current directory. To create working directories in the proper place, ActiveMQ must be launched from its home/installation directory.\n\nProceed to the #Starting ActiveMQ section of this document.\n\nProceed to #Testing the Installation section.\n\nUnix Developer's Release\nThis procedure explains how to download and install the latest developer's snapshot.\n\nOpen the release archive: https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/(open one of the SNAPSHOT directories)\nSelect the version of ActiveMQ to download (you may have to scroll down to see the ActiveMQ snapshots).The filename will be similar to: activemq-x.x.x-tar.gz.\nExtract the files from the gzip file into a directory of your choice. For example:For a binary developer's snapshot:\ntar zxvf activemq-x.x.x.tar.gz\nFor a source developer's snapshot:\ntar zxvf activemq-x.x.x-src.tar.gz\n\nIf a binary snapshot was downloaded, to make it executable, the ActiveMQ script may need its permissions changed:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]/bin\nchmod 755 activemq\n\nFor a binary snapshot, proceed to the #Starting ActiveMQ section of this document.\n\nIf a source snapshot was downloaded perform steps 6 - 8 of the #Unix Source Installation procedure.\nProceed to the #Testing the Installation section.\n\nStarting ActiveMQ\nThere now follows instructions on how to run the ActiveMQ Message Broker.\nOn Windows:\nFrom a console window, change to the installation directory and run ActiveMQ:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]\nwhere activemq_install_dir is the directory in which ActiveMQ was installed, e.g., c:\\Program Files\\ActiveMQ-5.x.Then type:\nbin\\activemq start\nNOTE: Working directories get created relative to the current directory. To create working directories in the proper place, ActiveMQ must be launched from its home/installation directory.\nOn Unix:\nFrom a command shell, change to the installation directory and run ActiveMQ as a foregroud process:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]/bin\n./activemq console\nFrom a command shell, change to the installation directory and run ActiveMQ as a daemon process:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]/bin\n./activemq start\nMore help\nFor other ways of running the broker see Here. For example you can run an embedded broker inside your JMS Connection to avoid starting a separate process.\nTesting the Installation\nUsing the administrative interface\n\nOpen the administrative interface\n\nURL: http://127.0.0.1:8161/admin/\nLogin: admin\nPasswort: admin\n\n\nNavigate to \"Queues\"\nAdd a queue name and click create\nSend test message by klicking on \"Send to\"\n\nLogfile and console output\nIf ActiveMQ is up and running without problems, the Window's console window or the Unix command shell will display information similar to the following log line:(see stdout output or \"[activemq_install_dir]/data/activemq.log\")\nApache ActiveMQ 5.11.1 (localhost, ID:ntbk11111-50816-1428933306116-0:1) started | org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerService | main\nListen port\nActiveMQ's default port is 61616. From another window run netstat and search for port 61616.\nFrom a Windows console, type:\nnetstat -an|find \"61616\"\nOR\nFrom a Unix command shell, type:\nnetstat -nl|grep 61616\nMonitoring ActiveMQ\nYou can monitor ActiveMQ using the Web Console by pointing your browser at\nhttp://localhost:8161/admin\nFrom ActiveMQ 5.8 onwards the web apps is secured out of the box.The default username and password is admin/admin. You can configure this in the conf/jetty-real.properties file.\nOr you can use the JMX support to view the running state of ActiveMQ.\nFor more information see the file docs/WebConsole-README.txt in the distribution.\nStopping ActiveMQ\nFor both Windows and Unix installations, terminate ActiveMQ by typing \"CTRL-C\" in the console or command shell in which it is running.\nIf ActiveMQ was started in the background on Unix, the process can be killed, with the following:\ncd [activemq_install_dir]/bin\n./activemq stop\nConfiguring ActiveMQ\nThe ActiveMQ broker should now run. You can configure the broker by specifying an Xml Configuration file as a parameter to the activemq command. An alternative is to use the Broker Configuration URI to configure things on the command line in a concise format (though the configuration options are not as extensive as if you use Java or XML code). You can also\nAlso see Configuring Transports to see how you can configure the various connection, transport and broker options using the connection URL in the ActiveMQConnectionFactory.\nSee the Initial Configuration for details of which jars you need to add to your classpath to start using ActiveMQ in your Java code\nIf you want to use JNDI to connect to your JMS provider then please view the JNDI Support. If you are a Spring user you should read about Spring Support\nAfter the installation, ActiveMQ is running with a basic configuration. For details on configuring options, please see refer to the Configuration section.\nAdditional Resources\nIf you are new to using ActiveMQ, running the Web Samples or the Examples is a good next step to learn more about ActiveMQ.\nThe Commercial Providers listed on the Support page may also have additional documentation, examples, tutorials, etc... that can help you get started.\n"},"Community/faq.html":{"url":"Community/faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- FAQ \nCommunity > FAQ\nFAQ\nHere are a list of commonly asked questions and answers.

You may also find it useful to discuss your issues with the community on the Discussion Forums or join one of our Mailing Lists.\n\nIssue Tracker\nDiscussion Forums\nMailing Lists\nFAQ\n\nHow to get help\nBefore you report a problem you might want to read the FAQ.Whenever you are reporting a problem please be sure to include as much information as possible; the more we know the more chance of a quicker resolution.\n\nWhich version of ActiveMQ\nWhat platform of Java (e.g., Java SE 6 with JRE/JDK 1.6.0 or J2SE 5 with JRE/JDK 1.5.0)\nAny particular application/web server or container being used - if so what version?\nStack traces generally really help! If in doubt include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top. It's very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace.\nLog output (e.g., data/activemq.log) can be useful too; sometimes enabling DEBUG logging can help\nYour code & configuration files are often useful\n\nHow to get help faster\nWe can help you much quicker if you try the following\n\nProvide us with a JUnit test case that demonstrates your issue. e.g. if you think you've found a bug, can you create a test case to demonstrate the bug?\nSubmit a patch fixing the bug! (We also buy you beer when we meet you if you submit bug fixes  )\nFor memory leaks or performance related issues, if you can run a profiler on your test case and attach the output as a file (or zipped file if it's huge) to the JIRA we can normally fix things much faster. e.g. you could run jmap/jhat, JProfiler or YourKit on your code and send us the output. To find memory leaks it's quicker to resolve if you can tell us what classes are taking up all of the RAM; we can normally figure out what's wrong from that.\n\nCommercial Support\nThis is an open source project, so the amount of time we have available to help resolve your issue is often limited as all help is provided on a volunteer basis. If you want to get priority help, need to get up to speed quickly, require some training or mentoring, or need full 24 x 7 production support you should contact a commercial company specializing in ActiveMQ support such as...\n\napifocal is a Professional Services company.

Download the code & try it out and see what you think. Browse the source code. Got an itch to scratch, want to tune some operation or add some feature?\nWant to do some hacking on ActiveMQ? Try surfing to our issue tracker for open issues or features that need to be implemented, take ownership of an issue and try fix it.\nGetting in touch\nThere are various ways of communicating with the ActiveMQ community.\n\njoin us on the Discussion Forums or subscribe to the Mailing Lists and take part in any conversations\npop by on in irc and say hi\n\nadd some comments to the wiki\n\n\nIf you find a bug or problem\nPlease raise a new issue in our issue tracker\nIf you can create a JUnit test case then your issue is more likely to be resolved quicker.e.g. take a look at some of the existing unit tests cases\nThen we can add your issue to the test suite and then we'll know when its really fixed and we can ensure that the problem stays fixed in future releases.\nIf you want to help out with the documentation\nIf you want to contribute to the ActiveMQ documentation you should first subscribe our dev@ where ActiveMQ developers interact with each other. If you want edit rights on the ActiveMQ site, create an account in the ActiveMQ wiki and fill in and submit an ICLA to the ASF (see the Committer Guide). Then ask on the dev@ list to be granted edit rights and an admin will do so fairly quickly. If you want to just contribute the content, please submit the content on the dev@ list or create an issue and attach it there. All contributions are highly appreciated.\nWorking on the code\nGrab the Source from git\nBuild the project.\nexport MAVEN_OPTS=\"-Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M\"\nmvn -Dtest=false install\nPS: You might need to build multiple times (if you get a build error) because sometimes maven fails to download all the files.\nCreate a project in your IDE. e.g. if you are using Eclipse the following should do the trick.\nmvn eclipse:eclipse\nThen import the projects into your workspace.\nCreating patches\nWe gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix ActiveMQ in some way.\nMost IDEs can create nice patches now very easily. e.g. in Eclipse just right click on a file/directory and select Team -> Create Patch. Then just save the patch as a file and then submit it. (You may have to click on Team -> Share... first to enable the Subversion options).\nIf you're a command line person try the following to create the patch\ndiff -u Main.java.orig Main.java >> patchfile.txt\nor\ngit diff Main.java >> patchfile.txt\nSubmitting patches\nThe easiest way to submit a patch is to create a new JIRA issue, attach the patch and tick the ASF license grant check box, tick the Patch Attached button on the issue then fire off an email to the Mailing Lists or Discussion Forums.\nBecoming a commmitter\nOnce you've got involved as above, we may well invite you to be a committer. See Becoming a committer for more details.\nUsing the issue tracker\nBefore you can raise an issue in the issue tracker you need to register with it. This is quick & painless.\nIf you want to have a go at fixing an issue you need to be in the list of activemq-developers on the issue tracker. To join the group, please mail the dev@activemq.apache.org mail list with the email address you used to register with the issue tracker and we'll add you to the group.\nWhy not dive in the issue tracker, and try tackle some of our outstanding issues?\nBecoming a committer\nThe first step is contributing to the project; if you want to take that a step forward and become a fellow committer on the project then see the Committer Guide\n"},"Community/discussion-forums.html":{"url":"Community/discussion-forums.html","title":"Discussion Forums","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Discussion Forums \nCommunity > Discussion Forums\nBefore posting you might want to read the Tips for getting help.\nMany users prefer to use online forums rather than joining a mail list which can lead to lots more email traffic so we use the online forums at Nabble forums which also work with our Mailing Lists so that both stay completely in sync.

FE receives requests which processing is normally heavy time-consuming. Thus FE creates a message which is sent to BE for processing and returns a ticket (correlationID) to the user. This will later use the ticket to ask for the response of the processing (again sending a message from FE to BE which will respond synchronously in this case). So we want to have reliable messaging between our FE and BE.So far this is not entirely working for us.\nTom L.\nPromotional Marketing\nHere is our flow. The backend systems (written in a propriatery language) send requests to a tomcat server via http.

Currently we have advisory messages that support:\n\nconsumers, producers and connections starting and stopping\ntemporary destinations being created and destroyed\nmessages expiring on topics and queues\nbrokers sending messages to destinations with no consumers.\nconnections starting and stopping\n\nAdvisory messages can be thought as some kind of administrative channel where you receive information regarding what is happening on your JMS provider along with what's happening with producers, consumers and destinations. When you look at a broker via JMX you will see the advisory topics prefixed with ActiveMQ.Advisory..\nEvery Advisory has the message type 'Advisory' and some predefined message properties:\nProperty\nType\nDescription\nVersion\noriginBrokerId\nStringProperty\nThe id of the broker where the advisory originated.\n5.x\noriginBrokerName\nStringProperty\nThe name of the broker where the advisory originated.\n5.x\noriginBrokerURL\nStringProperty\nThe first URL of the broker where the advisory originated.\n5.2\nIn addition, some messages carry a Command object, which carries additional information about the nature of the advisory, e.g., a subscription to each of the destination returns an ActiveMQMessage. Specific DataStructure objects, e.g.,. ConsumerInfo, ProducerInfo, ConnectionInfo can be retrieved using ActiveMQMessage.getDataStructure().\nFor example:\nDestination advisoryDestination = AdvisorySupport.getProducerAdvisoryTopic(destination)\nMessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(advisoryDestination);\nconsumer.setMessageListener(this);\npublic void onMessage(Message msg){\n    if(msg instanceof ActiveMQMessage) {\n        try {\n             ActiveMQMessage aMsg = (ActiveMQMessage)msg;\n             ProducerInfo prod = (ProducerInfo) aMsg.getDataStructure();\n        } \n        catch(JMSException e) {\n            log.error(\"Failed to process message: \" + msg);\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe following advisory topics are supported\nClient based advisories\nTip\nThese are always generated.\nAdvisory Topics\nDescription\nProperties\nData Structure\nActiveMQ.Advisory.Connection\nConnection start & stop messages.\nConnectionInfo, RemoveInfo\nActiveMQ.Advisory.Producer.Queue\nProducer start & stop messages on a Queue.\nString='producerCount' - the number of producers\nProducerInfo\nActiveMQ.Advisory.Producer.Topic\nProducer start & stop messages on a Topic.\nString='producerCount' - the number of producers\nProducerInfo\nActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.Queue\nConsumer start & stop messages on a Queue.\nString='consumerCount' - the number of Consumers\nConnectionInfo, RemoveInfo\nActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.Topic\nConsumer start & stop messages on a Topic.\nString='consumerCount' - the number of Consumers\nConnectionInfo, RemoveInfo\nNote that the consumer start/stop advisory messages also have a consumerCount header to indicate the number of active consumers on the destination when the advisory message was sent.

In some cases it can make sense to disable all advisories.\nAdvisories need to be disabled both on the Broker, via XML Configuration\n\n\nor from java code:\nBrokerService broker = new BrokerService();\nbroker.setAdvisorySupport(false);\n// ...\nbroker.start();\nand on your ActiveMQConnectionFactory (because a subscription to an advisory topic will auto create it) via the brokerUrl:\ntcp://localhost:61616?jms.watchTopicAdvisories=false\nor via java code using the watchTopicAdvisories attribute on the ActiveMQConnectionFactory.\nActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory();\nfactory.setWatchTopicAdvisories(false);\nWarning\nAdvisory messages are required for dynamic network broker topologies as NetworkConnectors subscribe to advisory messages. In the absence of advisories, a network must be statically configured.\nUsing the Destinations\nAll of the above destinations are really prefixes which are appended with important information (like the actual topic or queue, the client ID, producer ID, consumer ID etc). This allows you to reuse the power of publish/subscribe, Wildcards and Selectors to filter the advisory messages as you see fit.\nFor example if you want to subscribe to expired messages on a topic FOO.BAR you could subscribe to ActiveMQ.Advisory.Expired.Topic.FOO.BAR. To subscribe to all messages of a certain kind of advisory just append .> to the topic, e.g., to subscribe to all the consumers starting and stopping to topics and queues subscribe to ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer..>.\nHelper Methods\nMethods to get the advisory destination objects are available in AdvisorySupport through the following methods.\nAdvisorySupport.getConsumerAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getProducerAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getExpiredTopicMessageAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getExpiredQueueMessageAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getNoTopicConsumersAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getNoQueueConsumersAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getDestinationAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getExpiredQueueMessageAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getExpiredTopicMessageAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getNoQueueConsumersAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getNoTopicConsumersAdvisoryTopic()\n// Version 5.2 on:\nAdvisorySupport.getSlowConsumerAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getFastProducerAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getMessageDiscardedAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getMessageDeliveredAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getMessageConsumedAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getMasterBrokerAdvisoryTopic()\nAdvisorySupport.getFullAdvisoryTopic()\nSome helper classes to deal with advisory messages are available in the advisories package.\n"},"Features/clustering.html":{"url":"Features/clustering.html","title":"Clustering","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Clustering \nFeatures > Clustering\nClustering is a large topic and often means different things to different people. We'll try to list the various aspects of clustering and how they relate to ActiveMQ\nQueue consumer clusters\nActiveMQ supports reliable high performance load balancing of messages on a queue across consumers. In enterprise integration, this scenario is known as the competing consumers pattern. The following figure illustrates the concept:\n\nThis solution receives the messages sent by the producers, enqueues them and distributes them between all the registered consumers. This has a number of benefits:\n\nThe load is distributed in a very dynamic fashion. Additional consumers could be provisioned and attached to the queue in high load periods, without modifying any configuration in the queue, as the new consumer would behave as just another competing consumer.\nBetter availability than systems using a load balancer. Load balancers usually rely on a monitorization system to find out which real-servers are unavailable. With competing consumers, a failed consumer won't be competing for messages and therefore messages won't be delivered to it even without monitorization.\nHigh reliability, if a consumer fails, any unacknowledged messages are redelivered to other consumers on the queue.\n\nOn the downside, this pattern might not be ideal in systems where the order processing is required. To mitigate this problem while maintaining the benefits, the competing consumers pattern should be used in conjunction with other ActiveMQ features like the exclusive consumers and the message groups as stated in the ActiveMQ's FAQ.\nBroker clusters\nThe most common mental model of clustering in a JMS context is that there is a collection of JMS brokers and a JMS client will connect to one of them; then if the JMS broker goes down, it will auto-reconnect to another broker.\nWe implement this using the failover:// protocol in the JMS client. See the Failover Transport Reference page for details of how to configure the failover protocol. Note: The reliable:// protocol in ActiveMQ 3.x has now been changed to the failover:// protocol\nIf we just run multiple brokers on a network and tell the clients about them using either static discovery or dynamic discovery, then clients can easily failover from one broker to another. However, stand alone brokers don't know about consumers on other brokers; so if there are no consumers on a certain broker, messages could just pile up without being consumed. We have an outstanding feature request to tackle this on the client side - but currently the solution to this problem is to create a Network of brokers to store and forward messages between brokers.\nDiscovery of brokers\nWe support auto-discovery of brokers using static discovery or dynamic discovery, so clients can automatically detect and connect to a broker out of a logical group of brokers as well for brokers to discover and connect to other brokers to form large networks.\nNetworks of brokers\nIf you are using client/server or hub/spoke style topology and you have many clients and many brokers, there is a chance that one broker has producers but no consumers, so that messages pile up without being processed. To avoid this, ActiveMQ supports a Networks of Brokers which provides store and forward to move messages from brokers with producers to brokers with consumers which allows us to support distributed queues and topics across a network of brokers.\nThis allows a client to connect to any broker - and fail over to another broker if there is a failure - providing a cluster of brokers from the clients perspective.\nNetworks of brokers also allows us to scale up to a massive number of clients in a network as we can run as many brokers as we need.\nYou can think of this as a cluster of clients connecting with a cluster of brokers with auto-failover and discovery, making a simple and easy to use messaging fabric.\nMaster Slave\nThe problem with running lots of stand alone brokers or brokers in a network is that messages are owned by a single physical broker at any point in time. If that broker goes down, you have to wait for it to be restarted before the message can be delivered. (If you are using non-persistent messaging and a broker goes down you generally lose your message).\nThe idea behind MasterSlave is that messages are replicated to a slave broker so that even if you have a catastrophic hardware failure of the master's machine, file system or data centre, you get immediate failover to the slave with no message loss.\nReplicated Message Stores\nAn alternative to MasterSlave is to have some way to replicate the message store; so for the disk files to be shared in some way. For example using a SAN or shared network drive you can share the files of a broker so that if it fails another broker can take over straight away.\nSo by supporting a Replicated Message Store you can reduce the risk of message loss to provide either a HA backup or a full DR solution capable of surviving a data centre failure.\n"},"Connectivity/cross-language-clients.html":{"url":"Connectivity/cross-language-clients.html","title":"Cross Language Clients","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Cross Language

ActiveMQ (either on the JMS client or in the broker process) to support smart routing, transformation and a whole host of other powerful patterns. You can of course just embed Camel library directly into your application, such as via Spring as well..\nThis also means you can cleanly integrate all of the Camel Components into ActiveMQ so you can easily integrate with CXF, Files, JBI, JPA, Mail, MINA, Quartz, XMPP and many other protocols and transports!\nUsing EIP in the ActiveMQ Broker\nThe broker's activemq.xml file comes already configured to support Camel; you just need to customize the routing rules.\nWriting EIP rules using Java code\nTo use Java code to write EIP routing rules, just put your classes on the classpath (such as in activemq/lib/myroutes/foo.jar). Then to get Camel to find your routes you need to edit the activemq.xml so that the packages attribute points to the package name (or a parent package name) to look for.\nFor example if all your routes are in the package org.acme.cheese; such as org.acme.cheese.whatnot.MyRouter then you could edit the XML to be...\n\n org.acme.cheese\n\n\nWriting EIP rules using XML\nTo use XML its even easier, as you can just embed whatever routing rules inside the  element using Camel's Spring XML format. Note that the XML is way more verbose than the Java DSL but it is a bit simpler to deploy. e.g. for a trivial route...\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nUsing EIP in the JMS client\nYou can use Camel Endpoints directly from your JMS client one of the following JMS destinations, depending on what JMS API you want it to use\n\nCamelDestination\nCamelQueue\nCamelTopic\n\nYou can then use this destination like any other JMS destination when sending or receiving messages!

They provide:\n\nGuaranteed ordering of the processing of related messages across a single queue.\nLoad balancing of the processing of messages across multiple consumers.\nHigh availability / auto-failover to other consumers if a JVM goes down.\n\nSo logically Message Groups are like a parallel Exclusive Consumer. Rather than all messages going to a single consumer, the standard JMS header JMSXGroupID is used to define which message group the message belongs to. The Message Group feature then ensures that all messages for the same message group will be sent to the same JMS consumer - whilst that consumer stays alive. As soon as the consumer dies another will be chosen.\nAnother way of explaining Message Groups is that it provides sticky load balancing of messages across consumers; where the JMSXGroupID is kinda like a HTTP session ID or cookie value and the message broker is acting like a HTTP load balancer.\nExample Use Case\nLets say we are doing some kind of order matching system where people are buying and selling things (stocks, shares, placing online bets, whatever). You want to have consumers who match bids and offers for different items (stocks / bets) so they want to keep in RAM for performance a sub-set of the data set. Therefore set the JMSXGroupID to be MSFT, IBM, SUNW and so forth to use the stock symbol to define the message group. (It can be any string whatsoever; maybe combining trading book, trading exchange, date and so forth - the more specific the group ID, the more concurrent you can run). Assume we are buying and selling MSFT, IBM, SUNW shares; the Message Groups feature guarantees that all the MSFT messages will be processed in order by the same consumer; ditto for IBM and SUNW.\nHow Message Groups Work\nWhen a message is being dispatched to a consumer, the JMSXGroupID is checked. If one is present then the broker checks to see if a consumer owns that message group. Since there could be a large number of message groups hash buckets are used rather than the actual JMSXGroupID string.\nIf no consumer is associated with a message group a consumer is chosen. Said JMS MessageConsumer will receive all further messages with the same JMSXGroupID value until:\n\nthe consumer closes (or the client which created the consumer dies etc).\nsomeone closes the message group by sending a message with a negative value for JMSXGroupSeq (see below for more details).\n\nNote: as with message selector matching, grouping based on JMSXGroupID occurs before dispatch on messages in memory. With the default maxPageSize option, large backlogs of messages destined for one group can block receipt of messages to other groups if they don't all fit in memory. You can change the default maxPageSize setting for destinations as follows:\n\n    \n       \n           \" maxPageSize=\"1000\"/>\n       \n    \n\n\nUsing Message Groups\nYou just need to change your JMS producers to fill in the JMSXGroupID message header with some String value of your choice.\nExample:\nMesasge message = session.createTextMessage(\"hey\");\nmessage.setStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupID\", \"IBM_NASDAQ_20/4/05\");\n...\nproducer.send(message);\nClosing a Message Group\nYou generally don't need to close a message group; just keep using it. However if you really do want to close a group you can add a negative sequence number.\nExample:\nMesasge message = session.createTextMessage(\"hey\");\nmessage.setStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupID\", \"IBM_NASDAQ_20/4/05\");\nmessage.setIntProperty(\"JMSXGroupSeq\", -1);\n...\nproducer.send(message);\nThis then closes the message group so if another message is sent in the future with the same message group ID it will be reassigned to a new consumer.\nImplications\nMessage Groups mean you get the power of grid processing of messages across a cluster of consumers with reliability, auto-failover, load balancing but you can also order the processing of messages too. So its the best of both worlds. However using the above example, what Message Groups actually do is to partition your work load across consumers using a user definable partition strategy - the JMSXGroupID value.\nThe neat thing about this is that you can do neat things like use lots of RAM caching; keep the order for MSFT in RAM in the MSFT consumer; keep the IBM orders in RAM in the IBM consumer - since the message broker is partitioning for you, you do not have to rely on a distributed cache with inter-cache synchronization and locking to take advantage of caching.\nThe great thing is - to the application developer, it looks like a simple 1 consumer world where you process messages and do your job; leaving the broker to do all the hard stuff for you\n\npartitioning the traffic\nload balancing of message groups across consumers\nauto-failover of groups to different consumers as consumers come and go\n\nIn summary; if ordering or per-message caching and synchronization are in any way important to you then we highly recommend you use message groups to partition your traffic.\nGetting Notified of Ownership Changes of Message Groups\nActiveMQ support a boolean header called JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer. This header is set on the first message sent to a consumer for a particular message group.\nIf the JMS connection is using failover: and a temporary network error occurs so that the connection disconnects from the broker and reconnects some time later, a new consumer instance will be created under the covers of the JMS client leading to the possibility of another message with this header being set for the same message group.\nExample:\nString groupId = message.getStringProperty(\"JMSXGroupId\");\nif (message.getBooleanProperty(\"JMSXGroupFirstForConsumer\")) {\n   // flush cache for groupId\n}\nTo flush caches to ensure consistent state when faced with network errors.\nAdding New Consumers\nIf you have existing messages in the broker and add consumers at a later stage, it is a good idea to delay message dispatch start until all consumers are present (or at least to give enough time for them to subscribe). If you don't do that the first consumer will probably acquire all message groups and all messages will be dispatched to it. You can achieve this by using consumersBeforeDispatchStarts and timeBeforeDispatchStarts destination policies.\nWhen both consumersBeforeDispatchStarts and timeBeforeDispatchStarts are set to a value greater than zero, the dispatching will start as soon as the required number of consumers are present or the timeBeforeDispatchStarts timeout expires. If only consumersBeforeDispatchStarts is set then the timeout for consumers to connect is 1 second. If all consumers disconnect then message dispatch delay will be applied again at the next consumer connection.\nHere's the example of the destination policy that delays dispatch for 200ms:\n\n  \n    \n      \" timeBeforeDispatchStarts=\"200\"/>\n    \n  \n\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to wait for two consumers (or two seconds) before dispatch starts:\n\n  \n    \n      \" consumersBeforeDispatchStarts=\"2\" timeBeforeDispatchStarts=\"2000\"/>\n    \n  \n\n\nAs the appropriate test case shows, adding a small time pause before dispatching or setting a minimum consumer number, ensures equal message group distribution.\nCompeting demands of memory consumption, load balancing, complexity, etc.\nThe default behavior which is limited to 1024 message groups in an LRU cache may not match you expectation w.r.t message order... some detail to explain:\nMessageGroupHashBucket and SimpleMessageGroupMap message groups work by associating each group with a consumer.\nSimpleMessageGroupMap keeps track of every group but suffers from unbounded memory use.\nMessageGroupHashBucked keeps track of every group and has bounded memory use.\nCachedMessageGroupMap has bounded memory use, but only keeps track of up to 1024 (or the maximum configured size) groups, then loses track of any groups older than the newest 1024.\nIn this way, if there are more groups than the maximum, ordering will be lost for the oldest groups.\nTypically users would close groups such that the in memory set can be retained below the configured limits.

By default a network connection is one way only - the broker that establishes the connection passes messages to the broker(s) its connected to. From version 5.x of ActiveMQ, a network connection can be optionally enabled to be duplex, which can be useful for hub and spoke architectures, where the hub is behind a firewall etc.\nConfiguring a network of brokers\nThe easiest way to configure a network of brokers is via the Xml Configuration. There are two main ways to create a network of brokers\n\nuse a hard coded list of networkConnector elements.\n\nuse Discovery to detect brokers (multicast or rendezvous).\n\n\nExample with a fixed list of URIs\nHere is an example of using the fixed list of URIs\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n   \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nActiveMQ also supports other transports than tcp to be used for the network connector such as http.\nExample using multicast discovery\nThis example uses multicast discovery\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nStarting network connectors\nBy default, network connectors are initiated serially as part of the broker start up sequence. When some networks are slow, they prevent other networks from starting in a timely manner. Version 5.5 supports the broker attribute networkConnectorStartAsync=\"true\" which will cause the broker to use an executor to start network connectors in parallel, asynchronous to a broker start.\nStatic discovery\nWith static: discovery you can hard code the list of broker URLs. A network connector will be created for each one.\n\n  \n\nThere are some useful properties you can set on a static network connector for retries:\nproperty\ndefault\ndescription\ninitialReconnectDelay\n1000\ntime(ms) to wait before attempting a reconnect (if useExponentialBackOff is false)\nmaxReconnectDelay\n30000\ntime(ms) to wait before attempting to re-connect\nuseExponentialBackOff\ntrue\nincreases time between reconnect for every failure in a reconnect sequence\nbackOffMultiplier\n2\nmultipler used to increase the wait time if using exponential back off\ne.g.\nuri=\"static:(tcp://host1:61616,tcp://host2:61616)?maxReconnectDelay=5000&useExponentialBackOff=false\"\nMasterSlave Discovery\nA common configuration option for a network of brokers is to establish a network bridge between a broker and an n+1 broker pair (master/slave). Typical configurations involve using the failover: transport, but there are a some other non-intuitive options that must be configured for it to work as desired. For this reason, ActiveMQ v5.6+ has a convenience discovery agent that can be specified with the masterslave: transport prefix:\n\n  \n\nThe URIs are listed in order for: MASTER,SLAVE1,SLAVE2...SLAVE\nThe same configuration options for static: are available for masterslave:\nNetworkConnector Properties\nproperty\ndefault\ndescription\nname\nbridge\nname of the network - for more than one network connector between the same two brokers - use different names\ndynamicOnly\nfalse\nif true, only activate a networked durable subscription when a corresponding durable subscription reactivates, by default they are activated on startup.\ndecreaseNetworkConsumerPriority\nfalse\nif true, starting at priority -5, decrease the priority for dispatching to a network Queue consumer the further away it is (in network hops) from the producer. When false all network consumers use same default priority(0) as local consumers\nnetworkTTL\n1\nthe number of brokers in the network that messages and subscriptions can pass through (sets both message&consumer -TTL)\nmessageTTL\n1\n(version 5.9) the number of brokers in the network that messages can pass through\nconsumerTTL\n1\n(version 5.9) the number of brokers in the network that subscriptions can pass through (keep to 1 in a mesh)\nconduitSubscriptions\ntrue\nmultiple consumers subscribing to the same destination are treated as one consumer by the network\nexcludedDestinations\nempty\ndestinations matching this list won't be forwarded across the network (this only applies to dynamicallyIncludedDestinations)\ndynamicallyIncludedDestinations\nempty\ndestinations that match this list will be forwarded across the network n.b. an empty list means all destinations not in the exluded list will be forwarded\nuseVirtualDestSubs\nfalse\nif true, the network connection will listen to advisory messages for virtual destination consumers\nstaticallyIncludedDestinations\nempty\ndestinations that match will always be passed across the network - even if no consumers have ever registered an interest\nduplex\nfalse\nif true, a network connection will be used to both produce AND Consume messages. This is useful for hub and spoke scenarios when the hub is behind a firewall etc.\nprefetchSize\n1000\nSets the prefetch size on the network connector's consumer. It must be > 0 because network consumers do not poll for messages\nsuppressDuplicateQueueSubscriptions\nfalse\n(from 5.3) if true, duplicate subscriptions in the network that arise from network intermediaries will be suppressed. For example, given brokers A,B and C, networked via multicast discovery. A consumer on A will give rise to a networked consumer on B and C. In addition, C will network to B (based on the network consumer from A) and B will network to C. When true, the network bridges between C and B (being duplicates of their existing network subscriptions to A) will be suppressed. Reducing the routing choices in this way provides determinism when producers or consumers migrate across the network as the potential for dead routes (stuck messages) are eliminated. networkTTL needs to match or exceed the broker count to require this intervention.\nbridgeTempDestinations\ntrue\nWhether to broadcast advisory messages for created temp destinations in the network of brokers or not. Temp destinations are typically created for request-reply messages. Broadcasting the information about temp destinations is turned on by default so that consumers of a request-reply message can be connected to another broker in the network and still send back the reply on the temporary destination specified in the JMSReplyTo header. In an application scenario where most/all messages use request-reply pattern, this will generate additional traffic on the broker network as every message typically sets a unique JMSReplyTo address (which causes a new temp destination to be created and broadcasted via an advisory message in the network of brokers).When disabling this feature such network traffic can be reduced but then producer and consumers of a request-reply message need to be connected to the same broker. Remote consumers (i.e. connected via another broker in your network) won't be able to send the reply message but instead raise a \"temp destination does not exist\" exception.\nalwaysSyncSend\nfalse\n(version 5.6) When true, non persistent messages are sent to the remote broker using request/reply in place of a oneway. This setting treats both persistent and non-persistent messages the same.\nstaticBridge\nfalse\n(version 5.6) If set to true, broker will not dynamically respond to new consumers. It will only use staticallyIncludedDestinations to create demand subscriptions\nuserName\nnull\nThe username to authenticate against the remote broker\npassword\nnull\nThe password for the username to authenticate against the remote broker\nReliability\nNetworks of brokers do reliable store and forward of messages. If the source is durable, persistent messages on a queue or a durable topic subscription, a network will retain the durability guarantee.However networks cannot add durability when the source is non durable. Non durable topic subscriptions and temporary destinations (both queues and topics) are non durable by definition. When non durablesources are networked, in the event of a failure, inflight messages can be lost.\nOrdering\nTotal message ordering is not preserved with networks of brokers. Total ordering works with a single consumer but a networkBridge introduces a second consumer. In addition, network bridge consumers forward messages via producer.send(..), so they go from the head of the queue on the forwarding broker to the tail of the queue on the target. If single consumer moves between networked brokers, total order may be preserved if all messages always follow the consumer but this can be difficult to guarantee with large message backlogs.\nWhen to use and not use Conduit subscriptions\nActiveMQ relies on information about active consumers (subscriptions) to pass messages around the network. A broker interprets a subscription from a remote (networked) broker in the same way as it would a subscription from a local client connection and routes a copy of any relevant message to each subscription. With Topic subscriptions and with more than one remote subscription, a remote broker would interpret each message copy as valid, so when it in turns routes the messages to its own local connections, duplicates would occur. Hence default conduit behavior consolidates all matching subscription information to prevent duplicates flowing around the network. With this default behaviour, N subscriptions on a remote broker look like a single subscription to the networked broker.\nHowever - duplicate subscriptions is a useful feature to exploit if you are only using Queues. As the load balancing algorithm will attempt to share message load evenly, consumers across a network will equally share the message load only if the flag conduitSubscriptions=false. Here's an example. Suppose you have two brokers, A and B, that are connected to one another via a forwarding bridge. Connected to broker A, you have a consumer that subscribes to a queue called Q.TEST. Connected to broker B, you have two consumers that also subscribe to Q.TEST. All consumers have equal priority. Then you start a producer on broker A that writes 30 messages to Q.TEST. By default, (conduitSubscriptions=true), 15 messages will be sent to the consumer on broker A and the resulting 15 messages will be sent to the two consumers on broker B. The message load has not been equally spread across all three consumers because, by default, broker A views the two subscriptions on broker B as one. If you had set conduitSubscriptions to false, then each of the three consumers would have been given 10 messages.\nDuplex network connectors\nBy default a network bridge forwards messages on demand in one direction over a single connection. When duplex=true, the same connection is used for a network bridge in the opposite directions, resulting in a bi-directional bridge. The network bridge configuration is propagated to the other broker so the duplex bridge is an exact replica or the original.\nGiven two brokers, broker A and broker B, a duplex bridge on A to B is the same as a default bridge on A to B and a default bridge on B to A.\nNote, if you want to configure more than one duplex network bridge between two brokers, to increase throughput or to partition topics and queues, you must provide unique names for each:\n\n        \n                \n                        \n                \n        \n        \n                \n                        \n                \n        \n  \n\nConduit subscriptions and consumer selectors\nConduit subscriptions ignore consumer selectors on the local broker and send all messages to the remote one. Selectors are then parsed on the remote brokers before messages are dispatched to consumers. This concept could create some problems with consuming on queues using selectors in a multi-broker network. Imagine a situation when you have a producing broker forwarding messages to two receiving brokers and each of these two brokers have a consumer with different selector. Since no selectors are evaluated on the producer broker side, you can end up with all messages going to only one of the brokers, so messages with certain property will not be consumed. If you need to support this use case, please turn off conduitSubscription feature.\nConfiguration Pitfalls\nNetworks do not work as expected (they cannot dynamically respond to new consumers) if the advisorySupport broker property is disabled. A fully statically configured network is the only option if advisorySupport is disabled. Read more about it in the following section.\nNetworks of brokers and advisories\nNetwork of brokers relies heavily on advisory messages, as they are used under the hood to express interest in new consumers on the remote end. By default, when network connector starts it defines one consumer on the following topic ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.> (let's ignore temporary destination for the moment). In this way, when consumer connects (or disconnects) to the remote broker, the local broker will get notified and will treat it as one more consumer it had to deal with.\nThis is all fine and well in small networks and environments whit small number of destinations and consumers. But as things starts to grow a default model (listen to everything, share everything) won't scale well. That's why there are many ways you can use to filter destinations that will be shared between brokers.\nDynamic networks\nLet's start with dynamically configured networks. This means that we only want to send messages to the remote broker when there's a consumer there. If we want to limit this behavior only on certain destinations we will use dynamicallyIncludedDestinations, like\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nIn versions of ActiveMQ prior to 5.6, the broker would still use the same advisory filter and express interest in all consumers on the remote broker. The actual filtering will be done during message dispatch. This is suboptimal solution in huge networks as it creates a lot of \"advisory\" traffic and load on the brokers. Starting with version 5.6, the broker will automatically create an appropriate advisory filter and express interest only in dynamically included destinations. For our example it will be \"ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.Queue.include.test.foo,ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.Topic.include.test.bar\". This can dramatically improve behavior of the network in complex and high-load environments.\nIn older broker versions we can achieve the same thing with a slightly more complicated configuration. The actual advisory filter that controls in which consumers we are interested is defined with the destinationFilter connector property. Its default value is \">\", which is concatenated to the \"ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.\" prefix. So to achieve the same thing, we would need to do the following:\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNote that first destination does not have the prefix because it's already implied. It's a bit more complicated to set and maintain, but it will work. And if you're using 5.6 or newer version of the broker just including desired destinations with dynamicallyIncludedDestinations should suffice.\nThis also explains why dynamic networks do not work if you turn off advisory support on the brokers. The brokers in this case cannot dynamically respond to new consumers.\nPure static networks\nIf you wish to completely protect the broker from any influence of consumers on the remote broker, or if you wish to use the brokers as a simple proxy and forward all messages to the remote side no matter if there are consumers there or not, static networks are something you should consider.\n\n        \n              \n        \n\n\nThe staticBridge parameter is available since version 5.6 and it means that the local broker will not subscribe to any advisory topics on the remote broker, meaning it is not interested in whether there are any consumers there. Additionally, you need to add a list of destinations to staticallyIncludedDestinations. This will have the same effect as having an additional consumer on the destinations so messages will be forwarded to the remote broker as well. As there is no staticBridge parameter in the earlier versions of ActiveMQ, you can trick the broker by setting destinationFilter to listen to an unused advisory topic, like\n\n        \n              \n        \n\n\nIf configured like this, broker will try to listen for new consumers on ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.NO_DESTINATION, which will never have messages so it will be protected from information on remote broker consumers.\nDynamic networks and Virtual Destinations (New for 5.13.0)\nAs described above, a network of brokers can be configured to only send messages to a remote broker when there's a consumer on an included destination.  However, let's consider some cases of how dynamic flow occurs when Virtual Destinations are in use.\nVirtual Destination consumers and Composite Destinations\nHere is an example of two brokers networked together.  The Local Broker contains the network connector configured with a dynamicallyIncludedDestination and the Remote Broker is configured with a CompositeTopic:\nLocal Broker\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nRemote Broker\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nIn this example, let's consider a single consumer on the Remote Broker on the queue include.bar.forward.  If a message is sent directly to the Remote Broker on the topic include.bar, it will be forwarded to the queue include.bar.forward and the consumer will receive it.  However, if a message is published to the same topic on the Local Broker, this message will not be forwarded to the Remote Broker.\nThe message is not forwarded because a consumer on the queue include.bar.forward would not be detected as part of the dynamicallyIncludedDestinations list in the Local Broker.  Messages would not be forwarded to the Remote Broker unless there was a consumer on the original topic as well (in this case include.bar).  This can be fixed by configuring the Local Broker to listen for Virtual Destination Subscriptions.  \nFirst, we need to configure the Remote Broker to send advisory messages when consumers subscribe to a destination that matches a Virtual Destination.  In this case, internally a match is determined through the use of a Destination Filter that determines whether one destination forwards to another destination.  To enable this, set the property useVirtualDestSubs on the Remote Broker to true:\nRemote Broker\n\n\n\n    \n     .....\n  \n\n\n\n\nNext, the network connector on the Local Broker needs to be configured to listen for the new advisory messages by setting the useVirtualDestSubs property to true:\nLocal Broker\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nNow, if a consumer comes subscribes to the queue include.bar.forward on the Remote Broker, the Local Broker will forward messages that are sent to the topic include.bar.\nVirtual Destination Consumers on Destination Creation\nNow let's consider the use case above where there is the same composite topic but no consumers on the queue.  \nRemote Broker\n\n    \n        \n    \n\nThere is a Composite Topic configured on the Remote Broker, and the Local Broker is networked to it.  \nEven though we have enabled useVirtualDestSubs, messages will not be forwarded to the Remote Broker unless a consumer subscribes to the forwarded queue.  Without a consumer, messages would be dropped as they are sent to a topic on the Local Broker (include.bar).  In this situation it is desirable to have messages forwarded based on the existence of a virtual destination that forwards to:\n\none or more queues; or\ntopics that have durable subscriptions.\n\nBoth of these conditions are considered as emitting demand for messages to the Local Broker, despite there being no active consumers on those destinations.\nRemote Broker\n\n\n\n    \n     .....\n  \n\n\n\nWith this configuration, when the queue include.bar.forward is created, a Virtual Destination consumer advisory will be sent to the Local Broker so that it knows to forward messages based on the existence of the Composite Topic that forwards to a queue.\nComposite Destination consumers and Virtual Topics\nThe above examples show how to configure a Composite Destination but a Virtual Topic will also work.  In the example below, a consumer on a queue for a Virtual Topic on the Remote Broker will now cause demand and messages will be sent across a network from the Local Broker.\nLocal Broker\n\n  \n    \"/>\n  \n\n\nRemote Broker\n\n\n\n    \n     .....\n  \n\n\n\nExample Configuration using NetworkConnector properties\nThis part of an example configuration for a Broker\n\n      \n          \n              \n              \n          \n          \n              \n              \n          \n        \n              \n              \n          \n      \n    \n\nNote that at the moment excludedDestinations property doesn't affect staticallyIncludedDestinations.\nIt is possible to have more than one network connector between two brokers. Each network connector uses one underlying transport connection, so you may wish to do this to increase throughput, or have a more flexible configuration.\nFor example, if using distributed queues, you may wish to have equivalent weighting to queue receivers across the network, but only when the receivers are active - e.g.\n\n      \n          \n              \"/>\n          \n      \n    \n\nN.B. You can only use wildcards in the excludedDestinations and dynamicallyIncludedDestinations properties.N.B. Do not change the name of the bridge or the name of the Broker if you are using durable topic subscribers across the network. Internally ActiveMQ uses the network name and broker name to build a unique but repeatable durable subscriber name for the network.\nStuck Messages (version 5.6)\nBy default, it is not permissible for a message to be replayed back to the broker from which it came. This ensures that messages do not loop when duplex or by directional network connectors are configured. Occasionally it is desirable to allow replay for queues. Consider a scenario where a bidirectional bridge exists between a broker pair. Producers and Consumers get to randomly choose a broker using the failover transport. If one broker is restarted for maintenance, messages accumulated on that broker, that crossed the network bridge, will not be available to consumers till they reconnect to the broker. One solution to this problem is to force a client reconnect using rebalanceClusterClients. Another, is to allow replay of messages back to the origin as there is no local consumer on that broker.There is a destination policy that allows this behavior for queues by configuring a conditionalNetworkBridgeFilterFactory with replayWhenNoConsumers=true. The conditionalNetworkBridgeFilterFactory provides an optional replayDelay based on the broker-in time.\n\n  \n    \n      \" enableAudit=\"false\">\n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nN.B.: When using replayWhenNoConsumers=true for versions **enableAudit=false** as the cursor could mark the replayed messages as duplicates (depending on the time window between playing and replaying these messages over the network bridge). The problem is fully explained in this blog post.\nThrottling a network consumer\nThe conditionalNetworkBridgeFilterFactory factory allows a rate limit to be specified for a destination, such that network consumer can be throttled. Prefetch for a network consumer is largely negated by the fact that a network consumer relays a message typically acks very quickly so even with a low prefetch and decreased priority a network consumer can starve a modestly quick local consumer. Throttling provides a remedy for this.\n"},"Features/performance.html":{"url":"Features/performance.html","title":"Performance","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Performance \nFeatures > Performance\nPerformance\nPerformance differs greatly depending on many different factors\n\nthe network topology\ntransport protocols used\nquality of service\nhardware, network, JVM and operating system\nnumber of producers, number of consumers\ndistribution of messages across destinations along with message size\n\nTo give you an idea of the kinds of performance you can expect from ActiveMQ we have a bunch of JMeter Performance Tests that you can run on your hardware with the protocols of your choice.\nThe last test run we ran was on a small network of 2 dual CPU opteron linux boxes (64 bit) running SuSe and with Java 5 from Sun.\nWhen running the server on one box and a single producer and consumer thread in separate VMs on the other box, using a single topic we got around 21-22,000 messages/second using 1-2K messages.

It handles using Apache ZooKeeper to pick a master from a set of broker nodes configured to replicate single LevelDB Store. Then synchronizes all slave LevelDB Stores with the master keeps them up to date by replicating all updates to the master. This might become the preferred Master Slave configuration going forward.\nActiveMQ V5.8\nIn ActiveMQ 5.8, the LevelDB Store was introduced. The LevelDB Store is a file based persistence database. It has been optimized to provide even faster persistence than KahaDB. Although not yet the default message store, we expect this store implementation become the default in future releases.\nActiveMQ V5.3\nFrom 5.3 onwards - we recommend you use KahaDB - which offers improved scalability and recoverability over the AMQ Message Store.The AMQ Message Store which although faster than KahaDB - does not scales as well as KahaDB and recovery times take longer.\nActiveMQ V4\nFor long term persistence we recommend using JDBC coupled with our high performance journal. You can use just JDBC if you wish but its quite slow.\nOur out of the box default configuration uses Apache Derby as the default database, which is easy to embed - but we support all the major SQL databases - just reconfigure your JDBC configuration in the Xml Configuration.\nHigh performance journal - ActiveMQ 4.x\nTo achieve high performance of durable messaging in ACtiveMQ V4.x we strongly recommend you use our high performance journal - which is enabled by default. This works rather like a database; messages (and transcation commits/rollbacks and message acknowledgements) are written to the journal as fast as is humanly possible - then at intervals we checkpoint the journal to the long term persistence storage (in this case JDBC).\nIts common when using queues for example that messages are consumed fairly shortly after being published; so you could publish 10,000 messages and only have a few messages outstanding - so when we checkpoint to the JDBC database, we often have only a small amount of messages to actually write to JDBC. Even if we have to write all the messages to the JDBC, we still get performance gains with the journal, since we can use a large transaction batch to insert the messages into the JDBC database to boost performance on the JDBC side.\nOur journal is based on lots of the great work in the Howl project; we keep close ties to the Howl community. However since ActiveMQ has to handle arbitarily large message sizes, we've had to make our journal handle any size of message and so we don't use the fixed size record model that Howl uses.\nConfiguring persistence\nFor full explict control over configuration check out the Xml Configuration. However a quick way to set which persistence adapter to use is to set the following system property to be the class name of the PersistenceAdapter implementation.\nactivemq.persistenceAdapter\nWhen running the broker from the command line, we look for the activemq.xml on the classpath unless you specify one to use. e.g.AMQ 4.x\nactivemq xbean:file:myconfig.xml\nAMQ 3.x\nactivemq myconfig.xml\nor justAMQ3.x/AMQ4.x\nactivemq\nHere is a sample XML configuration which shows how to configure the journal and the JDBC persistence.\nAMQ 5.x\nxml      -->      -->              --> \nFor more details see the Initial Configuration guide.\nJDBC Persistence without Journaling\nTo enable JDBC persistence of JMS messages without journaling, we need to change the message broker's default persistence configuration fromAMQ 4.x\n  \n\nto\n  \n\nFor AMQ 3.x\n    \n\nto\n  \n\nMake sure to send durable messages so that it will be persisted in the database server while waiting to be consumed by clients.

Refer to the documentation for more detail.\nTypically you configure JAAS using a config file like this one and set the java.security.auth.login.config system property to point to it. If no system property is specified then by default the ActiveMQ JAAS plugin will look for login.config on the classpath and use that.\nAuthentication Example\nHere is an example login.config which then points to these files\n\nusers.properties\ngroups.properties\n\nNote: Until version 5.11.1, these property files got reloaded on every authentication request by default. So updates to users, password and groups were loaded immediately. From 5.12 onward they only get reloaded if reload=true is set in your LoginModule configuration, e.g.\nactivemq { org.apache.activemq.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule required org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.user=\"users.properties\" org.apache.activemq.jaas.properties.group=\"groups.properties\" reload=true; };\nIf reload=true is not set, these property files get loaded on broker startup only!! See AMQ-5876 for details.\nSimple Authentication Plugin\nIf you have modest authentication requirements (or just want to quickly set up your testing environment) you can use SimpleAuthenticationPlugin. With this plugin you can define users and groups directly in the broker's XML configuration. Take a look at the following snippet for example:\nxml      \nUsers and groups defined in this way can be later used with the appropriate authorization plugin.\nAnonymous access\nFrom version 5.4.0 onwards, you can configure simple authentication plugin to allow anonymous access to the broker.\nxml      \nTo allow anonymous access to the broker, use anonymousAccessAllowed attribute and set it to true as shown above. Now, when the client connects without username and password provided, a default username (anonymous) and group (anonymous) will be assigned to its security context. You can use this username and password to authorize client's access to appropriate broker resources (see the next section). You can also change username and group that will be assigned to anonymous users by using anonymousUser and anonymousGroup attributes.\nAuthorization\nIn ActiveMQ we use a number of operations which you can associate with user roles and either individual queues or topics or you can use wildcards to attach to hierarchies of topics and queues.\nOperation\nDescription\nread\nYou can browse and consume from the destination\nwrite\nYou can send messages to the destination\nadmin\nYou can lazily create the destination if it does not yet exist. This allows you fine grained control over which new destinations can be dynamically created in what part of the queue/topic hierarchy\nQueues/Topics can specified using the ActiveMQ Wildcards syntax.\nAuthorization Example\nThe following example shows these 2 plugins in operation. Though note its very easy to write your own plugin.{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=activemq/trunk/activemq-unit-tests/src/test/resources/org/apache/activemq/security/jaas-broker.xml}Note that full access rights should generally be given to the ActiveMQ.Advisory destinations because by default an ActiveMQConnection uses destination advisories to get early knowledge of temp destination creation and deletion. In addition, dynamic network connectors use advisories to determine consumer demand.If necessary, the use of advisories in this manner can be disabled via the watchTopicAdvisories boolean attribute of ActiveMQConnectionFactory and for a networkConnector, via the network connector staticBridge(5.6) boolean attribute.\nBroker-to-Broker Authentication and Authorization\nIf you have enabled authentication for a particular message broker, then other brokers that wish to connect to that broker must provide the proper authentication credentials via their  element. For example, suppose that we have a network of brokers with the following configuration:\n\nThe network of brokers comprises two brokers (BrokerA and BrokerB)\nAuthentication for BrokerA has been enabled via the example  element.\nAuthentication for BrokerB has not been enabled.\nBrokerA only listens for connections. In other words, BrokerA has a  element, but no  elements.\n\nIn order for BrokerB to connect to BrokerA, the corresponding  element in BrokerB's XML configuration file must be set up as follows.\nxml  \nNote how BrokerB's  element must provide the proper credentials in order to connect to BrokerA. If authorization has been enabled on BrokerA, then the userName assigned to the  element must also have the proper authorization credentials. Messages cannot be forwarded from BrokerB to BrokerA if BrokerA has authorization enabled and BrokerB's corresponding  element's userName has not been given the proper authorization credentials.\nAlso, if BrokerA is given a  element so that it can initiate a connection to BrokerB, then that  must be given a userName/password combination that is defined in the  element; this is required even though BrokerB does not have authentication services enabled.\nControlling Access To Temporary Destinations\nTo control access to temporary destinations, you will need to add a  element to the authorizationMap. Through this element, you control access to all temporary destinations. If this element is not present, read, write, and admin privileges for temporary destinations will be granted to all. In the example below, read, write, and admin privileges for temporary destinations are only granted to those clients that have been assigned to the 'admin' group.\nxml ..  ..      \" read=\"all\" write=\"all\" admin=\"all\"/>        ..  .. \nLDAP Authentication Using the JAAS Plugin\nNew module\nA new/better ldap authorization module is available since 5.6.

Start up ActiveMQ\n5. Test it out\nSecurity and ActiveMQ Components\nAlong with the message broker, you can optionally execute several additional \"components\", such as Camel and/or the Web console. These components establish connections with the broker; therefore, if you have secured your broker (i.e., enabled authentication), you will have to configure these components in order to have them provide the required security credentials (username, password) when they connect to the broker.\nCamel\nYou may have the following Camel context defined in your broker's XML configuration file.\nxml For more details see  ** http://activemq.apache.orgFeatures/enterprise-integration-patterns.md -->  org.foo.bar     \nThe above configuration is not set up to work within a secure environment.\nIf the application is running in an OSGi container, add the following line before the CamelContext definition:\nxml\nThis allows any pre-configured instance of the ActiveMQComponent deployed in the container to take precedence on the default ActiveMQComponent.\nThat is, with the above configuration, Camel will establish a connection with ActiveMQ, but will not provide a username and password. Therefore, when ActiveMQ security is enabled, the above configuration results in a security exception. The exception will be thrown multiple times, because Camel will continue to retry the connection. If you're not using Camel, comment out the above XML code. If you are using Camel, add the following bean definition to your broker's XML configuration:\nxml         \nWith the above bean definition, Camel will pass the specified security credentials when it connects to the broker.\nIf the broker is running in an OSGi container, add the following line after the ActiveMQComponent bean definition:\nxml\nWeb Console\nIf you want to use the Web Console with a secured broker, you have to change connectionFactory bean in your webapps/admin/WEB-INF/webconsole-embeded.xml to something like this:\nxml    \nDefault Credentials\nStarting with version 5.3, all of the above configuration details are included in the default ActiveMQ configuration. Also, there is a central place where you can set credentials that these components will use to connect to the broker. Just set your desired username and password in the conf/credentials.properties file, which by default looks like this:\nactivemq.username=system activemq.password=manager\nEncrypted Passwords\nAs of version 5.4.1 you can also use Encrypted passwords with your broker\nMessage level Authorization\nIt's also possible to authorize each single message using some content based authorization policy of your choosing. In comparison to the other security options described before, Message level Authorization requires a bit more than just some configuration. You have to start with creating a new maven project and add the activemq-all maven dependency (in the same version as your activemq installation) to the pom.xml of your new project.In the next step you have to create a new Java class and let it implement the org.apache.activemq.security.MessageAuthorizationPolicy interface. After that, simply add a method with signature:\npublic boolean isAllowedToConsume(ConnectionContext context, Message message){...}\nto the new Java class. For usage of your own Message level Authorization policy, the Java class has to be packaged as jar and added to the /lib folder of ActiveMQ to make it available for ActiveMQ. In the last step, it has to be configured on the broker directly by using the  messageAuthorizationPolicy property or add it to the XML as follows\nxml ..    .. \nImplementing your own custom Security Plugin\nAll of the various security implementations are implemented as Interceptors so its very easy to add your own custom implementation. Its probably easier to start with one of the simple implementations though if you are using JAAS you could derive from the JAAS implementation.\nThird Party Tools\n\nActiveMQ LDAP and JDBC Security Plugins from TTM Solutions\n\n"},"Features/Destination Features/virtual-destinations.html":{"url":"Features/Destination Features/virtual-destinations.html","title":"Virtual Destinations","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Virtual Destinations \nFeatures > Destination Features > Virtual Destinations\nVirtual Destinations allow us to create logical destinations that clients can use to produce and consume from but which map onto one or more physical destinations. It allows us to provide more flexible loosely coupled messaging configurations.\nVirtual Topics\nThe idea behind publish subscribe is a great one. Allow producers to be decoupled from consumers so that they do not even know how many consumers are interested in the messages they publish. The JMS specification defines support for durable topics however they have limitations as we will describe...\nThe limitations of JMS durable topics\nA JMS durable subscriber MessageConsumer is created with a unique JMS clientID and durable subscriber name. To be JMS compliant only one JMS connection can be active at any point in time for one JMS clientID, and only one consumer can be active for a clientID and subscriber name. i.e., only one thread can be actively consuming from a given logical topic subscriber. This means we cannot implement\n\nload balancing of messages.\nfast failover of the subscriber if that one process running that one consumer thread dies.\n\nNow queue semantics in JMS offer the ability to load balance work across a number of consumers in a reliable way - allowing many threads, processes and machines to be used to process messages. Then we have sophisticated sticky load balancing techniques like Message Groups to load balance and parallelise work while maintaining ordering.\nAnother added benefit of having physical queues for each logical topic subscriber is we can them monitor the queue depths via JMX to monitor system performance together with being able to browse these physical queues.\nVirtual Topics to the rescue\nThe idea behind virtual topics is that producers send to a topic in the usual JMS way. Consumers can continue to use the Topic semantics in the JMS specification. However if the topic is virtual, consumer can consume from a physical queue for a logical topic subscription, allowing many consumers to be running on many machines & threads to load balance the load.\nE.g., let's say we have a topic called VirtualTopic.Orders. (Where the prefix VirtualTopic. indicates its a virtual topic). And we logically want to send orders to systems A and B. Now with regular durable topics we'd create a JMS consumer for clientID_A and \"A\" along with clientID_B and \"B\".\nWith virtual topics we can just go right ahead and consume to queue Consumer.A.VirtualTopic.Orders to be a consumer for system A or consume to Consumer.B.VirtualTopic.Orders to be a consumer for system B.\nWe can now have a pool of consumers for each system which then compete for messages for systems A or B such that all the messages for system A are processed exactly once and similarly for system B.\nCustomizing the out-of-the-box defaults\nThe out-of-the-box defaults are described above. Namely that the only virtual topics available must be within the VirtualTopic.> namespace and that the consumer queues are named Consumer.*.VirtualTopic.>.\nYou can configure this to use whatever naming convention you wish. The following example shows how to make all topics virtual topics. The example below is using the name > to indicate 'match all topics'. You could use this wildcard to apply different virtual topic policies in different hierarchies.\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \" prefix=\"VirtualTopicConsumers.*.\" selectorAware=\"false\"/>   \n\n   \n\n  \n\n\n\nNote that making a topic virtual does add a small CPU overhead when sending messages to the topic but it is fairly small.\nOption\nDefault\nDescription\nselectorAware\nfalse\nonly messages that match one of the existing subscribers are actually dispatched. Using this option prevents the build up of unmatched messages when selectors are used by exclusive consumers\nlocal\nfalse\nwhen true, don't fan out messages that were received over a network\nconcurrentSend\nfalse\nwhen true, use an executor to fanout such that sends occur in parallel. This allows the journal to batch writes which will reduce disk io (5.12)\ntransactedSend\nfalse\nwhen true, use a transaction for fanout sends such that there is a single disk sync. A local broker transaction will be created if there is no client transaction (5.13)\ndropOnResourceLimit\nfalse\nwhen true, ignore any ResourceAllocationException thrown during fanout (see: sendFailIfNoSpace policy entry) (5.16)\nComposite Destinations\nComposite Destinations allow for one-to-many relationships on individual destinations; the main use case is for composite queues. For example when a message is sent to queue A you may want to forward it also to queues B and C and topic D. Composite destinations are then a mapping from a virtual destination to a collection of other physical destinations. In this case the mapping is broker side and the client is unaware of the mapping between the destinations. This is different from client side Composite Destinations where the client uses a URL notation to specify the actual physical destinations that a message must be sent to.\nThe following example shows how to set up a  element in the XML configuration so that when a message is sent to MY.QUEUE then it is really forwarded to the physical queue FOO and the topic BAR.\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBy default, subscribers cannot consume messages directly from a composite queue or topic - it is a logical construct only. Given the configuration above, subscribers can only consume messages from FOO and BAR; but not MY.QUEUE.\nThis behaviour can be altered to implement use cases such as watching a queue by sending the same messages to a notification topic (wire tapping), by setting the optionally set forwardOnly attribute to false.\n \n\n   \n\n    \n\n   \n\n \n\nMessages sent to IncomingOrders will all be copied and forwarded to Notifications, before being placed on the physical IncomingOrders queue for consumption by subscribers.\nWhere the forwardOnly attribute is not defined or is set to true, there is no logical difference between a compositeQueue and a compositeTopic - they can be used interchangeably. It is only when a composite destination is made physical through the use of forwardOnly that the choice of compositeTopic/compositeQueue has an impact on behavior.\nUsing filtered destinations\nFrom Apache ActiveMQ 4.2 onwards you can now use selectors to define virtual destinations.\nYou may wish to create a virtual destination which forwards messages to multiple destinations but applying a selector first to decide if the message really does have to go to a particular destination.\nThe following example shows how a message sent to the virtual destination MY.QUEUE will be forwarded to FOO and BAR if the selectors match\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n     \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\nAvoiding Duplicate Message in a Network of Brokers\nYou have to make sure that the messages sent to the Consumer.*.VirtualTopic.> destination are not forwarded when you're using both queue-based and non-queue based subscribers to the virtual topic (that is, if you have normal topic subscribers to the virtual topic). If you use Virtual Topics in a network of brokers, it is likely you will get duplicate messages if you use the default network configuration. This is because a network node will not only forward message sent to the virtual topic, but also the associated physical queues. To fix this, you should disable forwarding messages on the associated physical queues.\nHere is an example of how to do that:\n \n\n  \n\n \"/> \n\n  \n\n \n\n"},"Features/visualisation.html":{"url":"Features/visualisation.html","title":"Visualisation","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Visualisation \nFeatures > Visualisation\nInspired greatly by Gregor and Erik's great talk at TSSJS 2006 we've started to add some visualisation plugins into Apache ActiveMQ.\nConnection visualisation\nThere is a  broker plugin which generates a DOT file such as this example representing the connections, sessions, producers, consumers and the destinations they are using.\n\nDestination visualisation\nThere is a  broker plugin which generates a DOT file such as this example whenever a destination is created or destroyed in the broker.

This means you can create highly real time web applications taking full advantage of the publish/subscribe nature of ActiveMQ\nAjax allows a regular DHTML client (with JavaScript and a modern version 5 or later web browser) to send and receive messages over the web. Ajax support in ActiveMQ builds on the same basis as the REST connector for ActiveMQ which allows any web capable device to send or receive messages over JMS.\nTo see Ajax in action, try running the examples\nThe Servlet\nThe AMQ AjaxServlet needs to be installed in your webapplications to support JMS over Ajax:\n...\n  \n    AjaxServlet\n    org.apache.activemq.web.AjaxServlet\n  \n  ...\n  \n    AjaxServlet\n    /amq/*\n  \nThe servlet both serves the required js files and handles the JMS requests and responses.\nJavascript API\nThe ajax featues of amq are provided on the client side by the amq.js script. Beginning with ActiveMQ 5.4, this script utilizes one of three different adapters to support ajax communication with the server. Current jQuery, Prototype, and Dojo are supported, and recent versions of all three libraries are shipped with ActiveMQ.\n\n\n\n\n  var amq = org.activemq.Amq;\n  amq.init({ \n    uri: 'amq', \n    logging: true,\n    timeout: 20\n  });\n\n\nIncluding these scripts results in the creation of a javascript object called amq, which provides the API to send messages and to subscribe to channels and topics.\nSending a message\nAll that is required to send a JMS message from the javascript client, is to call the method:\namq.sendMessage(myDestination,myMessage);\nwhere myDestination is the URL string address of the destination (e.g. \"topic://MY.NAME\" or \"channel://MY.NAME\") and myMessage is any well formed XML or plain text encoded as XML content.\nReceiving messages\nTo receive messages, the client must define a message handling function and register it with the amq object. For example:\nvar myHandler =\n{\n  rcvMessage: function(message)\n  {\n     alert(\"received \"+message);\n  }\n};\namq.addListener(myId,myDestination,myHandler.rcvMessage);\nwhere myId is a string identifier that can be used for a later call to amq.removeHandler(myId) and myDestination is a URL string address of the destination (e.g. \"topic://MY.NAME\" or \"channel://MY.NAME\"). When a message is received, a call back to the myHandler.rcvMessage function passes the message to your handling code.The \"message\" is actually a text of the Text message or a String representation (toString()) in case of Object messages.\nBe aware that, by default, messages published via Stomp which include a content-length header will be converted by ActiveMQ to binary messages, and will not be visible to your web clients. Beginning with ActiveMQ 5.4.0, you can resolve this problem by always setting the amq-msg-type header to text in messages which will may be consumed by web clients.\nSelector support\nBy default, an ajax client will receive all messages on a topic or queue it is subscribed to. In ActiveMQ 5.4.1 amq.js supports JMS selectors since it is frequently useful to receive only a subset of these messages. Selectors are supplied to an amq.addListener call by way of an optional 4th parameter.\namq.addListener( myId, myDestination, myHandler.rcvMessage, { selector:\"identifier='TEST'\" } );\nWhen used in this way, the Javascript client will receive only messages containing an identifier header set to the value TEST.\nUsing AMQ Ajax in Multiple Browser Windows\nAll windows or tabs in a single browser share the same JSESSIONID on the ActiveMQ server. Unless the server can distinguish listeners from multiple windows, messages which were intended for 1 window will be delivered to another one instead. Effectively, this means that amq.js could be active in only a single browser window at any given time. Beginning in ActiveMQ 5.4.2, this is resolved by allowing each call to amq.init to specify a unique clientId. When this is done, multiple windows in the same browser can happily co-exist. Each can have a separate set of message subscriptions on the broker with no interactions between them.\nIn this example, we use the current time (at the time the web page is loaded) as a unique identifier. This is effective as long as two browser windows are not opened within the same millisecond, and is the approach used by the example chat.md included with ActiveMQ. Other schemes to ensure the uniqueness of clientId can easily be devised. Note that this clientId need only be unique within a single session. (Browser windows opened in the same millisecond in separate browsers will not interact, since they are in different sessions.)\norg.activemq.Amq.init({\n  uri: 'amq', \n  logging: true, \n  timeout: 45, \n  clientId:(new Date()).getTime().toString() \n});\nNote that this clientId is common to all message subscriptions in a single tab or window, and is entirely different from the clientId which is supplied as a first argument in amq.addListener calls.\n\nIn amq.init, clientId serves to distinguish different web clients sharing the same JSESSIONID. All windows in a single browser need a unique clientId when they call amq.init.\nIn amq.addListener, clientId is used to associate a message subscription with the callback function which should be invoked when a message is received for that subscription. These clientId values are internal to each web page, and do not need to be unique across multiple windows or tabs.\n\nHow it works\nAjaxServlet and MessageListenerServlet\nThe ajax featues of amq are handled on the server side by the AjaxServlet which extends the MessageListenerServlet. This servlet is responsible for tracking the existing clients (using a HttpSesssion) and lazily creating the AMQ and javax.jms objects required by the client to send and receive messages (eg. Destination, MessageConsumer, MessageAVailableListener). This servlet should be mapped to /amq/* in the web application context serving the Ajax client (this can be changed, but the client javascript amq.uri field needs to be updated to match.)\nClient Sending messages\nWhen a message is sent from the client it is encoded as the content of a POST request, using the API of one of the supported connection adapters (jQuery, Prototype, or Dojo) for XmlHttpRequest. The amq object may combine several sendMessage calls into a single POST if it can do so without adding additional delays (see polling below).\nWhen the MessageListenerServlet receives a POST, the messages are decoded as application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameters with their type (in this case send as opposed to listen or unlisten see below) and destination. If a destination channel or topic do not exist, it is created. The message is sent to the destination as a TextMessage.\nListening for messages\nWhen a client registers a listener, a message subscription request is sent from the client to the server in a POST in the same way as a message, but with a type of listen. When the MessageListenerServlet receives a listen message, it lazily creates a MessageAvailableConsumer and registers a Listener on it.\nWaiting Poll for messages\nWhen a Listener created by the MessageListenerServlet is called to indicate that a message is available, due to the limitations of the HTTP client-server model, it is not possible to send that message directly to the ajax client. Instead the client must perform a special type of Poll for messages. Polling normally means periodically making a request to see if there are messages available and there is a trade off: either the poll frequency is high and excessive load is generated when the system is idle; or the frequency is low and the latency for detecting new messages is high.\nTo avoid the load vs latency tradeoff, AMQ uses a waiting poll mechanism. As soon as the amq.js script is loaded, the client begins polling the server for available messages. A poll request can be sent as a GET request or as a POST if there are other messages ready to be delivered from the client to the server. When the MessageListenerServlet receives a poll it:\n\nif the poll request is a POST, all send, listen and unlisten messages are processed\nif there are no messages available for the client on any of the subscribed channels or topic, the servlet suspends the request handling until:\nA MessageAvailableConsumer Listener is called to indicate that a message is now available; or\nA timeout expires (normally around 30 seconds, which is less than all common TCP/IP, proxy and browser timeouts).\n\n\nA HTTP response is returned to the client containing all available messages encapsulated as text/xml.\n\nWhen the amq.js javascipt receives the response to the poll, it processes all the messages by passing them to the registered handler functions. Once it has processed all the messages, it immediately sends another poll to the server.\nThus the idle state of the amq ajax feature is a poll request \"parked\" in the server, waiting for messages to be sent to the client. Periodically this \"parked\" request is refreshed by a timeout that prevents any TCP/IP, proxy or browser timeout closing the connection. The server is thus able to asynchronously send a message to the client by waking up the \"parked\" request and allowing the response to be sent.\nThe client is able to asynchronously send a message to the server by creating (or using an existing) second connection to the server. However, during the processing of the poll response, normal client message sending is suspended, so that all messages to be sent are queued and sent as a single POST with the poll that will be sent (with no delay) at the end of the processing. This ensures that only two connections are required between client and server (the normal for most browsers).\nThreadless Waiting\nThe waiting poll described above is implemented using the Jetty 6 Continuations mechanism. This allows the thread associated with the request to be released during the wait, so that the container does not need to have a thread per client (which may be a large number). If another servlet container is used, the Continuation mechanism falls back to use a wait and the thread is not released.\nComparison to Pushlets\nFirstly we could easily add support for pushlets to ActiveMQ. However we prefer the Ajax approach for various reasons\n\nusing Ajax means that we use a distinct HTTP request for each send/receive which is much more friendly to web infrastructure (firewalls, proxies, caches and so forth) rather than having an infinitely-long GET.\n\nwe can still take advantage of HTTP 1.1 keep-alive sockets and pipeline processing to gain the efficiency of a single socket used for communication between the client and server side; though in a way that works with any HTTP-capable infrastructure\n\nthe server is pure REST and so will work with any client side (rather than being tied to custom JavaScript function calls used on the page which the Pushlet approach requires). So Pushlets tie the server to the web page; with Ajax we can have a generic service which works with any page.\n\nthe client can be in control over frequency of polling & timeouts. e.g. it can avoid the memory issues of Pushlets in some browsers by using a 20-second timeout HTTP GET.

Authorization policies are applied to a destination when it's accessed (read/write).\nSSL\nFor additional security AMQP can be configured to run over SSL as described in the following section.\nEnabling AMQP over NIO\nFor better scalability (and performance) the AMQP protocol should be configured to use NIO, rather than the default of TCP. To use NIO use the transport scheme amqp+nio instead of amqp.\nExample:\n\n\nThis transport uses the NIO transport underneath and will generally use much less threads than the standard connector. This connector can help if you want to use large number of queues\nEnabling AMQP over SSL\nIt's easy to configure ActiveMQ to use AMQP over a SSL connection. To use SSL use the transport scheme amqp+ssl instead of amqp.\nExample:\n\n\nFor more details on using SSL with ActiveMQ, see the following article (How do I use SSL).\nWorking with Destinations with AMQP\nYou should prefix destination address with queue:// to use queue based destinations or topic:// to use topic based destinations. The destination type defaults to queue when the destination prefix is omitted.\nPrefetch Size and Credit\nWhen AMQP receiver connects to the broker it's mapped to the JMS consumer. This JMS consumer has to have appropriate prefetch size set. The broker will honor the credit set by the client or use the default value of 1000 if client doesn't set it.\nExample: tuning the default prefetch size:\n\n\nIn this case, client preference will be ignored and the configured value will be used.\nYou can also tune broker-side amqp receiver link that handles incoming messages. It will use credit of 1000 messages by default, but you can override this by using producerCredit property, like \n\n\nMapping to JMS\nThere are three basic conversion strategies that can be used with AMQP and inter-operating with the JMS API.\nStrategy\nDescription\nnative\n(Default) Wraps the bytes of the AMQP message into a JMS BytesMessage and maps the headers of the AMQP message to headers on the JMS message.\nraw\nWraps the bytes of the AMQP message into a JMS BytesMessage.\njms\nMaps headers of the AMQP message to JMS message headers and the body of the AMQP message to the JMS body.\nSet the transformer transport option on the transportConnector to the desired mapping strategy.

ActiveMQ is a JMS 1.1 compliant, open source, Apache Licensed, message oriented middleware (MOM) with many, many features far beyond the JMS specification. ActiveMQ offers many different points of connectivity, many cross language clients and many pluggable transport protocols including integration with any J2EE 1.4 application server.\nOne of the application servers in the open source world is JBoss. A very common requirement is to configure ActiveMQ as the messaging infrastructure within JBoss. Although there is a bit of documentation on this integration, this article seeks to provide much more detail and explanation. So if you have a need to integrate ActiveMQ with JBoss, this article is for you.\nThis article explains how to configure JBoss to start up ActiveMQ as part of its lifecycle and how to configure the ActiveMQ resource adapter to handle the messaging and transactionality between ActiveMQ and JBoss.\nRequirements\nBelow are the software requirements for this article with links to download each:\n\nApache ActiveMQ 4.0.1+\nJBoss 4.0.4+\nSun Java 1.5+\nApache Ant 1.6+\n\nThough this article is using Unix, the installation and integration will work on any platform running Sun Java. It is recommended that each piece of software be downloaded before working through the steps is this article. Once each piece of software has been downloaded, proceed to the first step.\nInstall the J2SE 1.5\nThe first step in this process is to install Java 1.5 and verify that it runs correctly. Using the link above, find, download and install the correct version of Java for your platform. Once Java is installed and in the PATH, test it to see that it runs correctly using the following command:\n$ java -version\njava version \"1.5.0_06\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-112)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-64, mixed mode, sharing)\nDepending upon your platform and the exact build number of Java 1.5, your output may vary slightly. As long as it's Java 1.5 and the version information is output, you should be ready to proceed to the next step.\nInstall Apache Ant\nThe second step is to install Apache Ant. Simply download it using the link above, expand somewhere on your hard drive and place the bin directory in the PATH. This will allow you to test it quickly using the commands below:\n$ ant -version\nApache Ant version 1.6.2 compiled on July 16 2004\nAs long as you see the version output above, Ant should be usable. If you did not see the version output or received an error, consult the Ant documentation or mailing list archives to work out the issue. Please note that Ant is not used until the end of this whole exercise to test the integration.\nInstall the JBoss Application Server\nThe third step in this process is to install JBoss and make sure it runs correctly before installing and configuring ActiveMQ. Upon downloading JBoss-4.0.4, expand it in a place where it can create a directory. Next, run the server using the following commands:\n$ cd jboss-4.0.4.GA\n$ ./bin/run.sh -c default\n  JBoss Bootstrap Environment\n  JBOSS_HOME: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA\n  JAVA: java\n  JAVA_OPTS: -server -Xms128m -Xmx512m -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000 \n-Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000 -Dprogram.name=run.sh\n  CLASSPATH: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/bin/run.jar:/lib/tools.jar\n=========================================================================\n15:34:47,999 INFO  [Server] Starting JBoss (MX MicroKernel)...\n15:34:48,001 INFO  [Server] Release ID: JBoss [Zion] 4.0.4.GA (build: CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_4_GA date=200605151000)\n15:34:48,004 INFO  [Server] Home Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA\n15:34:48,005 INFO  [Server] Home URL: file:/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/\n15:34:48,007 INFO  [Server] Patch URL: null\n15:34:48,007 INFO  [Server] Server Name: default\n15:34:48,007 INFO  [Server] Server Home Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default\n15:34:48,011 INFO  [Server] Server Home URL: file:/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/\n15:34:48,012 INFO  [Server] Server Log Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/log\n15:34:48,017 INFO  [Server] Server Temp Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/tmp\n15:34:48,022 INFO  [Server] Root Deployment Filename: jboss-service.xml\n...\n15:35:17,360 INFO  [Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [4.0.4.GA (build: CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_4_GA date=200605151000)] \nStarted in 22s:238ms\nThe first few lines of output from the JBoss startup indicates the configuration being used but the last line is the most important one. It tells you that JBoss has been started successfully on your system. For an extra measure of assurance, visit http://localhost:8080/web-console/ in a web browser to make sure you are able to see the JBoss web console. If you can see this console, everything should be ready to go.\nAs a side note, the left-hand side of the web-console requires that the Java plugin be properly installed. This is supposed to take place when installing the J2SE, so if it did not work correctly for you, I suggest that you consult some documentation about any errors you may be seeing. The Java plugin is not required for JBoss or ActiveMQ to function properly, it is simply for the JBoss web-console.\nOnce JBoss is installed properly, shut it down using either the shutdown script or by simply typing ctrl-c to activate the shutdown hook. Once it is shut down, proceed to the next step.\nPrepare for Integrating Apache ActiveMQ with the JBoss Application Server\nThe fourth step is to prepare your environment for integrating ActiveMQ with JBoss. If you haven't done so already, download Apache ActiveMQ using the link above. As of the writing of this article, the latest released version is 4.0.2-RC4. Upon downloading this archive, expand it in a place where it can create a directory, preferably in the same location where JBoss was expanded. Verify that the ActiveMQ RAR file is included using the following commands:\n$ cd ./incubator-activemq-4.0.2.tar.gz\n$ jar tvf /opt/incubator-activemq-4.0.2/lib/optional/activemq-ra-4.0.2.rar\n     0 Mon Sep 25 19:00:50 MDT 2006 META-INF/\n   399 Mon Sep 25 19:00:48 MDT 2006 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\n   523 Mon Sep 25 13:07:40 MDT 2006 META-INF/DISCLAIMER.txt\n 11359 Mon Sep 25 13:07:40 MDT 2006 META-INF/LICENSE.txt\n 20305 Mon Sep 25 13:07:40 MDT 2006 META-INF/ra.xml\n  2334 Mon Sep 25 13:07:40 MDT 2006 broker-config.xml\n 70023 Mon Sep 25 19:00:48 MDT 2006 activemq-ra-4.0.2.jar\n1351744 Mon Sep 25 19:00:14 MDT 2006 activemq-core-4.0.2.jar\n232107 Mon Sep 25 18:22:48 MDT 2006 activeio-core-3.0-beta4.jar\n2143211 Tue Aug 01 11:44:50 MDT 2006 derby-10.1.1.0.jar\n1901653 Tue Aug 01 11:47:08 MDT 2006 spring-1.2.6.jar\n 94713 Tue Aug 01 11:47:22 MDT 2006 xbean-spring-2.2.jar\n 52915 Tue Aug 01 12:22:16 MDT 2006 commons-logging-1.1.jar\n 16030 Tue Aug 01 12:22:32 MDT 2006 geronimo-j2ee-management_1.0_spec-1.0.jar\n329586 Tue Aug 01 12:22:54 MDT 2006 backport-util-concurrent-2.1.jar\n358085 Tue Aug 01 12:23:26 MDT 2006 log4j-1.2.12.jar\n   523 Mon Sep 25 19:00:50 MDT 2006 META-INF/DISCLAIMER.txt\n 11359 Mon Sep 25 19:00:50 MDT 2006 META-INF/LICENSE.txt\nThis is simply a table of contents of the RAR file. There should only be one reason that this will fail - an incomplete download of the ActiveMQ tarball or zip file. Beyond that, depending on the version you download, some of the library versions may be slightly different.\nNow go back to the JBoss installation and create a directory for ActiveMQ in the JBoss deploy directory for the default JBoss context. Below are the commands to achieve this task:\n$ mkdir /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/deploy/activemq-ra.rar\n$ cd /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/deploy/activemq-ra.rar\n$ pwd\n/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/deploy/activemq-ra.rar\nNOTE: The creation of a directory is not required but is the easiest way to set up the ActiveMQ RAR when you're just getting started. This is due to the flexibility it affords during the development phase for the configuration to be changed very easily. The alternative is to JAR up the directory as a RAR file once the configuration is solid enough that it no longer needs to be changed. But leaving everything in a directory during development is the easiest path.\nNow expand the activemq-ra-4.0.2.rar into the current working directory:\njar xvf /opt/incubator-activemq-4.0.2/lib/optional/activemq-ra-4.0.2.rar\n  created: META-INF/\n inflated: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\n inflated: META-INF/DISCLAIMER.txt\n inflated: META-INF/LICENSE.txt\n inflated: META-INF/ra.xml\n inflated: broker-config.xml\n inflated: activemq-ra-4.0.2.jar\n inflated: activemq-core-4.0.2.jar\n inflated: activeio-core-3.0-beta4.jar\n inflated: derby-10.1.1.0.jar\n inflated: spring-1.2.6.jar\n inflated: xbean-spring-2.2.jar\n inflated: commons-logging-1.1.jar\n inflated: geronimo-j2ee-management_1.0_spec-1.0.jar\n inflated: backport-util-concurrent-2.1.jar\n inflated: log4j-1.2.12.jar\n inflated: META-INF/DISCLAIMER.txt\n inflated: META-INF/LICENSE.txt\nBelow is a quick listing of the contents of that directory:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 12848\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 bsnyder  bsnyder      204 Oct 16 16:27 META-INF\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder   232107 Oct 16 16:27 activeio-core-3.0-beta4.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder  1351744 Oct 16 16:27 activemq-core-4.0.2.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder    70023 Oct 16 16:27 activemq-ra-4.0.2.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder   329586 Oct 16 16:27 backport-util-concurrent-2.1.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder     2334 Oct 16 16:27 broker-config.xml\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder    52915 Oct 16 16:27 commons-logging-1.1.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder  2143211 Oct 16 16:27 derby-10.1.1.0.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder    16030 Oct 16 16:27 geronimo-j2ee-management_1.0_spec-1.0.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder   358085 Oct 16 16:27 log4j-1.2.12.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder  1901653 Oct 16 16:27 spring-1.2.6.jar\n-rw-r--r--   1 bsnyder  bsnyder    94713 Oct 16 16:27 xbean-spring-2.2.jar\nNow it's time to configure ActiveMQ.\nConfiguring Apache ActiveMQ\nThe fifth step is to actually configure ActiveMQ for integration with JBoss. Remember that you should be sitting in the following directory:\n/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/deploy/activemq-ra.rar\nYou may or may not have installed JBoss in /opt, that doesn't particularly matter. What does matter is that you're sitting in the directory that was created above to hold the contents of the expanded ActiveMQ RAR file.\nNOTE: A RAR file is a Resource adapter ARchive (RAR). Resource adapters are a concept from the J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) and are used to interface with Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), i.e., systems external to the application server (e.g., relational databases, mainframes, MOMs, accounting systems, etc.). Resource adapters are often referred to as J2EE connectors and are very similar to the concept of a device driver for, say, a printer in that they contain information specific to connecting to a particular system. The difference with JCA is that that connection has been formalized in specification for Java. So the overall concepts of JCA is for connection to any EIS, but what does that mean? JCA 1.5 provides connectivity and more via the following contracts:\nVersion 1.0 Contracts\nIn version 1.0 of the Connector Architecture, three contracts are defined to address the functions mentioned above:\n\nConnection Management Contract: Lets applications connect to an EIS through the resource adapter. It also allows the application server to pool connection requests to the EIS.\nTransaction Management Contract: Allows an application to manage and perform transactional access across one-to-many EIS resource managers.\nSecurity Contract: Provides support for secure access to the EIS.\n\nNew Contracts in Version 1.5\nIn version 1.5 of the J2EE Connector Architecture, there are more contracts that a resource adapter must support, as new functionality and features made their way into the specification. A resource adapter can support these four new contracts by implementing the required interfaces defined in the specification for each contract.\n\nLifecycle Management Contract: Lets the application server manage the lifecycle – that is, the startup and shutdown functionality – of the resource adapter.\nWork Management Contract: Allows the resource adapter to do work by submitting it to an application server for execution. Since the application server does the work for the resource adapter, the resource adapter needn't worry about thread management. Instead, the application server manages this aspect efficiently and can use thread pooling if necessary. Although the work management contract is not required (the resource adapter can choose to manage its own thread for work), it is definitely recommended.\nTransaction Inflow Contract: Allows a resource adapter to propagate an imported transaction to an application server, as well as flow-in transaction completion and crash recovery initiated by an EIS.\nMessage Inflow Contract: Allows the resource adapter to synchronously or asynchronously deliver messages to endpoints in the application server, irrespective of message style, semantics, and infrastructure.\n\nQuoted from What's New in the J2EE Connector Architecture 1.5\nFor more information about JCA, please consult the J2EE Connector Architecture documentation.\nOpen the META-INF/ra.xml file and look for the following section:\nMETA-INF/ra.xml\n\n    \n      The URL to the ActiveMQ server that you want this connection to connect to.  If using\n      an embedded broker, this value should be 'vm://localhost'.\n    \n    ServerUrl\n    java.lang.String\n    tcp://localhost:61616\nvm://localhost -->\n  \nThe section above is used to tell the ActiveMQ RAR where ActiveMQ is located. By default, the in-VM protocol is commented out in favor of the tcp protocol. This will find ActiveMQ running on any interface on the localhost on port 61616. It's ok to just leave this alone if you don't mind the inefficiency of communicating within the JVM via TCP. However, it is recommended that vm:// transport be used for an embedded broker, so comment out the tcp:// transport and uncomment the vm:// transport. Below is an example of this:\nMETA-INF/ra.xml\n\n    \n      The URL to the ActiveMQ server that you want this connection to connect to.  If using\n      an embedded broker, this value should be 'vm://localhost'.\n    \n    ServerUrl\n    java.lang.String\n    tcp://localhost:61616 -->\n    vm://localhost\n  \nBecause we're embedding ActiveMQ inside of JBoss, it is more efficient to use the vm:// transport, rather than to perform messaging over the tcp:// transport.\nNow look further down the META-INF/ra.xml file and locate the following section:\nMETA-INF/ra.xml\n\n    \n      Sets the XML configuration file used to configure the embedded ActiveMQ broker via\n      Spring if using embedded mode.\n  BrokerXmlConfig is the filename which is assumed to be on the classpath unless\n  a URL is specified. So a value of foo/bar.xml would be assumed to be on the\n  classpath whereas file:dir/file.xml would use the file system.\n  Any valid URL string is supported.\n\nBrokerXmlConfig\njava.lang.String\n\nxbean:broker-config.xml\n-->\n  \nThe section above needs to be changed to uncomment the second to last line and remove/replace the empty element that is above it. Below is an example of how this should be changed:\nMETA-INF/ra.xml\n\n    \n      Sets the XML configuration file used to configure the embedded ActiveMQ broker via\n      Spring if using embedded mode.\n  BrokerXmlConfig is the filename which is assumed to be on the classpath unless\n  a URL is specified. So a value of foo/bar.xml would be assumed to be on the\n  classpath whereas file:dir/file.xml would use the file system.\n  Any valid URL string is supported.\n\nBrokerXmlConfig\njava.lang.String\nxbean:broker-config.xml\n  \nThis change tells the ActiveMQ RAR to read a configuration file named broker-config.xml (the xbean: that proceeds the filename is simply a hint to class doing the reading of the configuration file) which is located on the CLASSPATH. In this case, the broker-config.xml file is located in the activemq-ra.rar directory. Save the changes to that file and then open the broker-config.xml file.\nThe broker-config.xml file is the ActiveMQ configuration file. This is the file used to configure ActiveMQ. The default contents of this file are usable, but should be customized to suit your environment. There are several items of note about this configuration. The most prominent sections to note in this file are the  element and the  and  elements as seen below:\nbroker-config.xml\n\n\n  \n  ...\n    \n      \n      \n      \n       -->\n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n      -->\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\nThe first change to this file is to add the brokerName attribute to the broker element and provide a name:\n\n\nIn addition, this same name is used further down the configuration to provide a name for the  element:\n\n\nNow we'll tell ActiveMQ not to initialize JMX because we'll use the existing one that JBoss has:\n\n\n  \n\n\nThe  element should be reconfigured to store its data in an appropriate place. On JBoss, that's most likely within the \"data\" directory of the server configuration you're using. We're going to set this dynamically using an XBean and Spring feature that allows us to inject system properties values into the configuration. First this needs to be enabled:\n\n\n\nNow, modify the dataDirectory attribute of the journaledJDBC element to be the following: ${jboss.server.data.dir}/activemq.\nThe  element is used to advertise the ActiveMQ broker for client-to-broker communications and the  element advertises the ActiveMQ broker for broker-to-broker communications. The default configuration is to use the ActiveMQ multicast transport for both. This is simply an easy configuration under which to get ActiveMQ up and running, so we'll just leave it at that for the time being.\nNOTE: There are far more configuration options available for ActiveMQ than are noted here. The configuration above is only enough to just get ActiveMQ up and running, nothing more. For more information on the ActiveMQ configuration, see the ActiveMQ 4.1 XML Reference.\nNow we just need to start up JBoss to assure that it comes up correctly without error using the same commands we used previously to start JBoss:\n$ cd jboss-4.0.4.GA\n$ ./bin/run.sh -c default\n  JBoss Bootstrap Environment\n  JBOSS_HOME: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA\n  JAVA: java\n  JAVA_OPTS: -server -Xms128m -Xmx512m -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000 \n-Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000 -Dprogram.name=run.sh\n  CLASSPATH: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/bin/run.jar:/lib/tools.jar\n=========================================================================\n15:34:47,999 INFO  [Server] Starting JBoss (MX MicroKernel)...\n15:34:48,001 INFO  [Server] Release ID: JBoss [Zion] 4.0.4.GA (build: CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_4_GA date=200605151000)\n15:34:48,004 INFO  [Server] Home Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA\n15:34:48,005 INFO  [Server] Home URL: file:/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/\n15:34:48,007 INFO  [Server] Patch URL: null\n15:34:48,007 INFO  [Server] Server Name: default\n15:34:48,007 INFO  [Server] Server Home Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default\n15:34:48,011 INFO  [Server] Server Home URL: file:/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/\n15:34:48,012 INFO  [Server] Server Log Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/log\n15:34:48,017 INFO  [Server] Server Temp Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/tmp\n15:34:48,022 INFO  [Server] Root Deployment Filename: jboss-service.xml\n...\n15:35:17,360 INFO  [Server] JBoss (MX MicroKernel) [4.0.4.GA (build: CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_4_GA date=200605151000)] \nStarted in 28s:576ms\nAs long as JBoss comes up without error, you're ready to move on to the next step.\nConfiguring JBoss\nThe sixth step is to configure JBoss to initialize and start ActiveMQ whenever JBoss starts up. This is accomplished using an XML file that abides by the JBoss JCA DTD for data sources. Like most other Java application servers on the market, the JBoss architecture uses the J2EE Connector Architecture to manage connections of any kind including JDBC, JMS, etc. and the JBoss JCA DTD denotes the allowed contents for creating an XML data source instance to configure JBoss JCA. Below is an example XML data source instance for use with JBoss:\nactivemq-jms-ds.xml\n\n\">http://www.jboss.org/j2ee/dtd/jboss-ds\\_1\\_5.dtd\">\n\n\n   \n      activemq/QueueConnectionFactory\n      \n      \n      activemq-ra.rar\n      javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory\n      vm://localhost\n      sa\n      \n      -->\n      1\n      200\n      30000\n      3\n   \n   \n      activemq/TopicConnectionFactory\n      \n      \n      activemq-ra.rar\n      javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory\n      vm://localhost\n      sa\n      \n      -->\n      1\n      200\n      30000\n      3\n   \n   \n      activemq/queue/outbound\n      jboss.jca:service=RARDeployment,name='activemq-ra.rar'\n      javax.jms.Queue\n      PhysicalName=queue.outbound\n   \n\n   \n      activemq/topic/inbound\n      jboss.jca:service=RARDeployment,name='activemq-ra.rar'\n      javax.jms.Topic\n      PhysicalName=topic.inbound\n   \n\n\nThis XML instance configures a JMS QueueConnectionFactory and a JMS TopicConnectionFactory and makes them available via JNDI. Also defined in this file are some s which are used to specify a topic and a queue. This file should be dropped into the JBoss deploy directory. Its name (*-ds.xml) will cause it to be picked up by the JBoss deployer upon startup. Speaking of which, once this file is in place, a quick smoke test can be performed by simply starting up the JBoss server. Below is an example of the output that should be seen:\n=========================================================================\n  JBoss Bootstrap Environment\n  JBOSS_HOME: /opt/jboss\n  JAVA: java\n  JAVA_OPTS: -server -Xms128m -Xmx512m -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000 \n-Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000 -Dprogram.name=run.sh\n  CLASSPATH: /opt/jboss/bin/run.jar:/lib/tools.jar\n=========================================================================\n22:55:48,686 INFO  [Server] Starting JBoss (MX MicroKernel)...\n22:55:48,688 INFO  [Server] Release ID: JBoss [Zion] 4.0.4.GA (build: CVSTag=JBoss_4_0_4_GA date=200605151000)\n22:55:48,690 INFO  [Server] Home Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA\n22:55:48,692 INFO  [Server] Home URL: file:/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/\n22:55:48,695 INFO  [Server] Patch URL: null\n22:55:48,697 INFO  [Server] Server Name: default\n22:55:48,698 INFO  [Server] Server Home Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default\n22:55:48,701 INFO  [Server] Server Home URL: file:/opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/\n22:55:48,702 INFO  [Server] Server Log Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/log\n22:55:48,704 INFO  [Server] Server Temp Dir: /opt/jboss-4.0.4.GA/server/default/tmp\n22:55:48,706 INFO  [Server] Root Deployment Filename: jboss-service.xml\n22:55:49,092 INFO  [ServerInfo] Java version: 1.5.0_06,Apple Computer, Inc.\n22:55:49,101 INFO  [ServerInfo] Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM 1.5.0_06-64,\"Apple Computer, Inc.\"\n22:55:49,102 INFO  [ServerInfo] OS-System: Mac OS X 10.4.8,i386\n22:55:49,803 INFO  [Server] Core system initialized\n22:55:53,379 INFO  [WebService] Using RMI server codebase: http://rattlesnake:8083/\n22:55:53,400 INFO  [Log4jService$URLWatchTimerTask] Configuring from URL: resource:log4j.xml\n22:55:54,034 INFO  [NamingService] JNDI bootstrap JNP=/0.0.0.0:1099, RMI=/0.0.0.0:1098, backlog=50, \nno client SocketFactory, Server SocketFactory=class\norg.jboss.net.sockets.DefaultSocketFactory\n22:55:58,475 INFO  [Embedded] Catalina naming disabled\n22:55:58,566 INFO  [ClusterRuleSetFactory] Unable to find a cluster rule set in the classpath. \nWill load the default rule set.\n22:55:58,569 INFO  [ClusterRuleSetFactory] Unable to find a cluster rule set in the classpath. \nWill load the default rule set.\n22:55:59,110 INFO  [Http11BaseProtocol] Initializing Coyote HTTP/1.1 on http-0.0.0.0-8080\n22:55:59,114 INFO  [Catalina] Initialization processed in 545 ms\n22:55:59,116 INFO  [StandardService] Starting service jboss.web\n22:55:59,121 INFO  [StandardEngine] Starting Servlet Engine: Apache Tomcat/5.5.17\n22:55:59,179 INFO  [StandardHost] XML validation disabled\n22:55:59,221 INFO  [Catalina] Server startup in 105 ms\n22:55:59,600 INFO  [TomcatDeployer] deploy, ctxPath=/invoker, warUrl=.../deploy/http-invoker.sar/invoker.war/\n22:55:59,874 INFO  [WebappLoader] Dual registration of jndi stream handler: factory already defined\n22:56:00,899 INFO  [TomcatDeployer] deploy, ctxPath=/, warUrl=.../deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar/ROOT.war/\n22:56:01,700 INFO  [TomcatDeployer] deploy, ctxPath=/jbossws, warUrl=.../tmp/deploy/tmp60528jbossws-exp.war/\n22:56:01,891 INFO  [SubscriptionManager] Bound event dispatcher to java:/EventDispatcher\n22:56:02,203 INFO  [TomcatDeployer] deploy, ctxPath=/jbossmq-httpil, \nwarUrl=.../deploy/jms/jbossmq-httpil.sar/jbossmq-httpil.war/\n22:56:04,546 INFO  [TomcatDeployer] deploy, ctxPath=/web-console, \nwarUrl=.../deploy/management/console-mgr.sar/web-console.war/\n22:56:05,690 INFO  [MailService] Mail Service bound to java:/Mail\n22:56:07,215 INFO  [RARDeployment] Required license terms exist, view META-INF/ra.xml in \n.../deploy/activemq-ra.rar/\n22:56:07,452 INFO  [XBeanXmlBeanDefinitionReader] Loading XML bean definitions from class \npath resource [broker-config.xml]\n22:56:07,750 INFO  [ClassPathXmlApplicationContext] Bean factory for application context \n[org.apache.xbean.spring.context.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;hashCode=13887543]:\norg.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory defining\nbeans [org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanBrokerService];

These are good indications that the configuration is correct, but needs to be verified a bit further. This is covered in the next section.\nTesting the Integration\nThe seventh and final step is to perform a slightly more comprehensive smoke test of the integration. This can be accomplished using Apache Ant via the examples that come with the ActiveMQ binary distribution. An Ant build.xml file is included which provides easy access to a simple consumer and a simple producer. The producer will be used to send messages that are received by the consumer. To proceed with this testing, just follow the steps below:\n\nIn the first terminal, start up JBoss. The same startup script can be used here as was used above.\nIn the second terminal, use the commands below to run the ActiveMQ consumer:\n$ cd /opt/incubator-activemq-4.0.2/examples    #note in activemq v5 the directory is just \"example\" not \"examples\"\n$ ant consumer\nBuildfile: build.xml\ninit:\n\\[mkdir\\] Created dir: /opt/incubator-activemq-4.0.2/example/target/classes\n\\[mkdir\\]

above just starts up JBoss. Step 2 above starts up a simple message consumer that comes with ActiveMQ. Step 3 above starts up a simple message producer that comes with ActiveMQ. Though the message consumer and message producer are simple utilities, the each one accepts many parameters making them extremely useful for testing ActiveMQ configurations.\nTo paraphrase, what just happened was that the message producer sent 10 messages to the TEST.FOO destination and the message consumer received 10 messages from the TEST.FOO destination. Despite being a simple test, it does utilize the ActiveMQ broker, albeit only on a single machine. The next logical step is to set up a full network of ActiveMQ brokers.\nAfter setting up one broker within one instance of JBoss, setting up another is made much easier, but requires another machine or operating system instance. But that's a whole separate article and something to address another day.\nConclusion\nWhat has been demonstrated here is the integration of ActiveMQ with the JBoss application server. This integration is quite common and performed by many enterprises. I hope that this was helpful to people interested in the integration of ActiveMQ with JBoss application server.

To consume a message use HTTP DELETE or GET.\nActiveMQ has a Servlet that takes care of the integration between HTTP and the ActiveMQ dispatcher.\nNOTE: The example below requires servlet mapping on the URL. For posting without the servlet mapping, see examples further down.\nYou can map a URI to the servlet and then use the relative part of the URI as the topic or queue name. e.g. you could HTTP POST to\nhttp://www.acme.com/orders/input\nwhich would publish the contents of the HTTP POST to the orders.input queue on JMS. \nSimilarly you could perform a HTTP DELETE GET on the above URL to read from the same queue. In this case we will map the MessageServlet from ActiveMQ to the URI\nhttp://www.acme.com/queue\nand configure it to accept the URI as a queue destination. We can do similar things to support topic destinations too.\nWe can use the HTTP session to denote a unique publisher or consumer.\nNote that strict REST requires that GET be a read only operation; so strictly speaking we should not use GET to allow folks to consume messages. Though we allow this as it simplifies HTTP/DHTML/Ajax integration somewhat.\nFor a more cleaner mapping of a simple transfer protocol to different languages, you might wish to take a look at Stomp.\nDefault configuration\nUntil version 5.8, REST API was part of the Web Samples and was mapped to http://localhost:8161/demo/message url. From 5.8 onwards, the API is available by default at http://localhost:8161/api/message url. Also, starting with 5.8, web server is secured by default (see Web Console for more information), so have that in mind when trying to use it. Examples below will assume new api location and secured web server.\nProducing\nYou can produce by sending a POST request to the server, like\ncurl -u admin:admin -d \"body=message\" http://localhost:8161/api/message/TEST?type=queue\nNOTE: If no type parameter is specified, the default is to create a  topic. To change the default to queue, initialize  the servlet  with an init param in the webapps/demo/WEB-INF/web.xml\nAs shown below:\n\n  MessageServlet  \n  org.apache.activemq.web.MessageServlet\n  1\n  \n     topic\n     false\n  \n\n\nAlternate Producing Syntax\nAn alternative syntax for posting is supported, using the destination URL-encoded parameter; here are some examples: \n# Send to queue orders.input:\ncurl -XPOST -d \"body=message\" http://admin:admin@localhost:8161/api/message?destination=queue://orders.input\n# Send to topic orders.input:\ncurl -XPOST -d \"body=message\" http://admin:admin@localhost:8161/api/message?destination=topic://orders.input\nTimeouts\nWhen reading from a queue we might not have any messages. We can use a timeout query parameter to indicate how long we are prepared to wait for a message to arrive. This allows us to poll or block until a message arrives.\nCouple this with HTTP 1.1 keep-alive sockets and pipeline processing we can have efficient access to JMS over HTTP.\nObviously if your client is Java then using ActiveMQ's JMS API is the fastest and most efficient way to work with the message broker; however, if you are not using Java or prefer the simplicity of HTTP then it should be fairly efficient, especially if your HTTP client supports keep-alive sockets and pipeline processing.\nConsuming\nWhen consuming messages using the REST API, you have to keep session alive between GET requests, or you'll create a separate consumer for every request and due to prefetch limit your succeeding call will hang.\nFor example, you can use wget to consume messages, like this:\nwget --user admin --password admin --save-cookies cookies.txt --load-cookies cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies  http://localhost:8161/api/message/TEST1?type=queue\nAlso, if you plan to have multiple consumer using REST, it's advisable to set prefetch size to 1 so all consumers have an equal chance of getting the message. You can do that by passing a special parameter to the MessageServlet\n\n    MessageServlet       \n    org.apache.activemq.web.MessageServlet\n    1\n    \n            destinationOptions\n            consumer.prefetchSize=1\n    \n\nin the webapps/demo/WEB-INF/web.xml\nAlternate Consuming Syntax\nAs with producing, an alternative syntax for consuming messages is also supported, using the destination URL-encoded parameter; here are some examples: \n# Send to queue orders.input:\ncurl -XGET http://admin:admin@localhost:8161/api/message?destination=queue://orders.input\n# Send to topic orders.input:\ncurl -XGET http://admin:admin@localhost:8161/api/message?destination=topic://orders.input\nConsuming without sessions\nSince 5.2.0 you can use clientId parameter to avoid storing actual JMS consumer in the request session. When using this approach, you don't need to keep sessions alive between requests, you just need to use the same clientId every time.\nwget --user admin --password admin http://localhost:8161/api/message/test?type=queue&clientId=consumerA\nEvery such call will use the same JMS consumer and deliver messages send to it by the broker.\nIn 5.4.1 it's also possible to unsubscribe the client. It's done by sending a POST call with clientId and action=unsubscribe parameters to the server, like\nhttp://localhost:8161/demo/message/test?clientId=consumerA&action=unsubscribe\nConsuming with selectors\nAs of ActiveMQ 5.4.0, you can use selectors when consuming using REST protocol. To do that, just specify the appropriate header with selector. To define a selector for the consumer, you have to provide it in an appropriate HTTP header. By default selector header name is selector, so the following example\nwget  --user admin --password admin --save-cookies cookies.txt --load-cookies cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies  --header=\"selector: test=2\" http://localhost:8161/api/message/test?type=queue\nshould consume only messages that have test property set to 2.\nYou can change the name of the selector header using the org.apache.activemq.selectorName Servlet context property in WEB-INF/web.xml, such as\n\n    org.apache.activemq.selectorName\n    activemq-selector\n\nFor more info, take a look at RestTest\nConsuming with One Shot Consumers\nOne shot consumption allows a REST call to receive a single message and then immediately close the associated consumer.\nAll of the examples so far lead to the servlet creating and holding on to consumers of the destination across multiple HTTP requests. Without care, these consumers could easily lead to confusion as messages are dispatched to them but then sit unused because the consuming HTTP session, or clientId, fails to connect to continue requesting the messages. One way around that problem is the use of one-shot consumers.  Simple add the ?oneShot=true option and the consumer is removed once the consumption completes; as follows:\ncurl -XGET http://admin:admin@localhost:8161/api/message?destination=queue://orders.input&oneShot=true\nNote that interrupting the call while the consumer is waiting for a message, the consumer may remain until the server times out the HTTP request, or until a message finally arrives.\nContent Types\nBy default messages are sent to the consumers with text/xml content type. Your REST-based application may expect JSON response instead of XML one. In that case, you can configure the servlet to send responses back by adding something like this\n\n    MessageServlet\n    org.apache.activemq.web.MessageServlet\n    1\n    \n            defaultContentType\n            application/json\n     \n\nto your WEB-INF/web.xml.\nA default content type can also be overridden using request headers. Specifying xml=true or json=true URL parameter you'll get a response with the desired content type.\nwget --user admin --password admin http://localhost:8161/api/message/TEST?type=queue\\\\&clientId=A\\\\&json=true\nSecurity\nSince 5.7.0 release REST API can connect to the secured brokers. The API uses basic authentication header format to get username and password information.\nFor example, with curl you can do something like\ncurl -u system:manager -d \"body=message\" http://localhost:8161/demo/message/TEST?type=queue\nAlso, you might want to enable ssl for your connections. To do that, just uncomment SecureConnector in conf/jetty.xml\n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \nRest Management\nStarting with version 5.8 we provide a REST management API for the broker. Using Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge it's possible to access all broker metrics (like memory usage) and execute management operations (like purging queues) using REST API. By default the management API is exposed at http://localhost:8161/api/jolokia/ URL. So you can for example get basic broker data with\nwget --user admin --password admin --auth-no-challenge http://localhost:8161/api/jolokia/read/org.apache.activemq:type=Broker,brokerName=localhost\nor to be more specific, total consumer count with\nwget --user admin --password admin --auth-no-challenge http://localhost:8161/api/jolokia/read/org.apache.activemq:type=Broker,brokerName=localhost/TotalConsumerCount\nFor more information on Jolokia protocol, see its reference manual. An API like this makes it easy to script monitoring and management operations against the broker, see also How can I monitor ActiveMQ?\nGotcha's and other trivia\n\nMissing \"body\" parameter\n\nIn the curl POST examples above, the use of \"body=...\" is critical. If this is not specified in front of the message body contents, the web servlet will attempt to read the body from the request (rather than from the -d parameter), and this will result in the following exception:\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: STREAMED\nat org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request.getReader(Request.java:898)\nat org.apache.activemq.web.MessageServletSupport.getPostedMessageBody(MessageServletSupport.java:347)\nat org.apache.activemq.web.MessageServlet.doPost(MessageServlet.java:126)\n...\nHowever, one option in this case would be to specify the content type explicitly:\ncurl -u admin:admin -d \"hello world $(date)\" -H \"Content-Type: text/plain\" -XPOST http://localhost:8161/api/message?destination=queue://abc.def\n"},"Connectivity/Protocols/rss-and-atom.html":{"url":"Connectivity/Protocols/rss-and-atom.html","title":"RSS and Atom","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- RSS and Atom \nConnectivity > Protocols > RSS and Atom\nWe have added support for the RESTful browsing of message queues in the activemq-web module.

The current views supported are\nView name\nDescription\nsimple\nRenders a list of  elements with an id attribute\nxml\nUses XStream to render the entire messages as XML\nrss\nUses Rome to render the messages as an RSS 0.9, 1.0, 2.0 or Atom 0.3 feed.

This makes it easy to write a client in pure Ruby, Perl, Python or PHP for working with ActiveMQ.\nPlease see the Stomp site for more details\nSpec Compliance\nActiveMQ v5.6 implements the Stomp v1.1 spec except for allowing spaces at the beginning or end of message header keys, they are preserved in the header values however. In future releases this will not be the case, clients should be updated and user code checked to ensure that spaces in the headers are there intentionally and not as a accident or a client \"feature\".\nEnabling the ActiveMQ Broker for Stomp\nTo enable STOMP protocol support in the broker add a transport connector definition whose URI scheme is stomp.\nExample:\n\n   \n\n\nTo see a full example, try this XML. If you save that XML as foo.xml then you can run stomp via the command line as\nactivemq xbean:foo.xml\nFor more help see Run Broker.\nThe Stomp Wire Format\nStomp uses a text based wire format that can be configured with the following options.  All options can be configured on a Brokers transport bind URI.\nParameter Name\nDefault Value\nDescription\nmaxDataLength\n104857600\nMaximum size of the message body (content) that can be sent.\nmaxFrameSize\nMAX_LONG\nFrom ActiveMQ 5.12.0: maximum frame size that can be sent. A Stomp frame includes a command, optional headers, and an optional body. Can help help prevent OOM DOS attacks\nExample:\n\n\nUse the Correct Prefix!\nWire format options must have the prefix wireFormat. to take effect, e.g., wireFormat.`maxDataLength`=100000. Options missing this prefix will be ignored.\nSecurity\nFrom ActiveMQ 5.1: Stomp fully supports ActiveMQ's security mechanism. This means that the CONNECT command will return an ERROR STOMP frame on unsuccessful authentication. Also, the authorization policies will be applied when you try to access (read/write) certain destinations. If you use synchronous operations (by using receipts), you can expect an ERROR frame in case of unauthorized access attempt. In other case, operations will be discarded but the client will not be informed of errors. This applies to all errors that can occur broker-side.\nSSL\nFor additional security, you can use Stomp over SSL as described in the following section.\nEnabling Stomp over NIO\nFrom ActiveMQ 5.3: for better scalability and performance the Stomp protocol can be configured to be run over the NIO transport. The NIO transport will use far fewer threads than the corresponding TCP connector. This can help when support for a large number of queues is required. To use NIO change the URI scheme of the transport connector to stomp+nio.\nExample:\n\n\nEnabling Stomp over SSL\nTo configure ActiveMQ to use Stomp over an SSL connection change the URI scheme to stomp+ssl.\nExample:\n\n\nFor more details on using SSL with ActiveMQ see the following article (How do I use SSL). An example of using Stomp over SSL on the client side can be found in the PHP Stomp client example.\nHeart-Beat Grace Period\nThe STOMP protocol (version 1.1 or greater) defines the concept of heart beats as a method by which a client and broker can determine the health of the underlying TCP connection between them. ActiveMQ supports STOMP heart beating provided the client is using version 1.1 (or greater) of the protocol.\nBefore ActiveMQ 5.9.0: enforcement of the 'read' heart-beat timeout (that is, a heart-beat sent from the client to the broker) was strict. In other words, the broker was intolerant of late arriving read heart-beats from the client. This resulted in the broker concluding that the client was no longer present causing it to close its side of the client's connection when the client failed to honor it's configured heart-beat settings.\nFrom ActiveMQ 5.9.0: the timeout enforcement for read heart-beats is now configurable via a new transport option transport.hbGracePeriodMultiplier:\n\n   \n\n\nThis multiplier is used to calculate the effective read heart-beat timeout the broker will enforce for each client's connection. The multiplier is applied to the read-timeout interval the client specifies in its CONNECT frame:\n** *  == **\nFor backward compatibility, if the grace period multiplier is not configured the default enforcement mode remains strict, e.g., transport.hbGracePeriodMultiplier=1.0. Attempts to configure the grace period multiplier to a value less than, or equal to 1.0 will be silently ignored.\nSTOMP clients that wish to be tolerant of late arriving heart-beats from the broker must implement their own solution for doing so.\n\nPlease check the STOMP specification for the details on heart-beating\n\nThe JIRA that implemented this: ActiveMQ 5.x does not support the notion of a grace-period for heart beats as supported by the STOMP protocol\n\n\nWorking with Destinations with Stomp\nNote that the prefix in stomp /queue/ or /topic/ is removed from the string before passing it to ActiveMQ as a JMS destination. Also note that the default separator in MOM systems is . (dot). Whilst FOO.BAR is the normal syntax to identify a queue type destination the Stomp equivalent is /queue/FOO.BAR\nBe careful about starting destinations with /\nIf in Stomp world you use /queue/foo/bar then in a JMS world the queue would be called foo/bar not /foo/bar.\nPersistent Messaging in STOMP\nSTOMP messages are non-persistent by default. To use persistent messaging add the following STOMP header to all SEND requests: persistent:true. This default is the opposite of that for JMS messages.\nWorking with JMS Text/Bytes Messages and Stomp\nStomp is a very simple protocol - that's part of the beauty of it! As such, it does not have knowledge of JMS messages such as TextMessage's or BytesMessage's. The protocol does however support a content-length header. To provide more robust interaction between STOMP and JMS clients, ActiveMQ keys off of the inclusion of this header to determine what message type to create when sending from Stomp to JMS. The logic is simple:\nInclusion of content-length header\nResulting Message\nyes\nBytesMessage\nno\nTextMessage\nThis same logic can be followed when going from JMS to Stomp, as well. A Stomp client could be written to key off of the inclusion of the content-length header to determine what type of message structure to provide to the user.\nMessage Transformations\nThe transformation message header on SEND and SUBSCRIBE messages could be used to instruct ActiveMQ to transform messages from text to the format of your desire. Currently, ActiveMQ comes with a transformer that can transform XML/JSON text to Java objects, but you can add your own transformers as well.\nHere's a quick example of how to use built-in transformer (taken from test cases)\nprivate String xmlObject = \"\\\\n\" \n        \\+ \"  Dejan\\\\n\"\n        \\+ \"  Belgrade\\\\n\" \n        \\+ \"\";\n\npublic void testTransformationReceiveXMLObject() throws Exception {\n\n    MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(new ActiveMQQueue(\"USERS.\" + getQueueName()));\n    ObjectMessage message = session.createObjectMessage(new SamplePojo(\"Dejan\", \"Belgrade\"));\n    producer.send(message);\n\n    String frame = \"CONNECT\\\\n\" + \"login: system\\\\n\" + \"passcode: manager\\\\n\\\\n\" + Stomp.NULL;\n    stompConnection.sendFrame(frame);\n\n    frame = stompConnection.receiveFrame();\n    assertTrue(frame.startsWith(\"CONNECTED\"));\n\n    frame = \"SUBSCRIBE\\\\n\" + \"destination:/queue/USERS.\" + getQueueName() + \"\\\\n\" + \"ack:auto\" + \"\\\\n\" + \"transformation:jms-object-xml\\\\n\\\\n\" + Stomp.NULL;\n    stompConnection.sendFrame(frame);\n\n    frame = stompConnection.receiveFrame();\n\n    assertTrue(frame.trim().endsWith(xmlObject));\n\n    frame = \"DISCONNECT\\\\n\" + \"\\\\n\\\\n\" + Stomp.NULL;\n    stompConnection.sendFrame(frame);\n}     \nDependencies\nActiveMQ uses XStream for its transformation needs. Since it's the optional dependency you have to add it to broker's classpath by putting the appropriate JAR into the lib/ folder. Additionally, if you plan to use JSON transformations you have to add Jettison JSON parser to the classpath.\nIn order to create your own transformer, you have to do the following:\n\nBuild your transformer by implementing a FrameTranslator interface\n\nAssociate it with the appropriate header value by creating a file named as a value you want to use in the META-INF/services/org/apache/activemq/transport/frametranslator/ folder of your JAR which will contain the value class=_fully qualified classname of your transformer_\n\n\nFor example the built-in transformer contains the following value:\nclass=org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.XStreamFrameTranslator\nin the META-INF/services/org/apache/activemq/transport/frametranslator/jms-xml file.\nDebugging\nIn case you want to debug Stomp communication between broker and clients you should configure the Stomp connector with the trace parameter, like this:\n\n   \n\n\nThis will instruct the broker to trace all packets it sends and receives.\nFurthermore, you have to enable tracing for the appropriate log. You can achieve that by adding the following to your conf/log4j.properties\nlog4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp=TRACE\nFinally, you will probably want to keep these messages in the separate file instead of polluting the standard broker's log. You can achieve that with the following log4j configuration:\nlog4j.appender.stomp=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender\nlog4j.appender.stomp.file=${activemq.base}/data/stomp.log\nlog4j.appender.stomp.maxFileSize=1024KB\nlog4j.appender.stomp.maxBackupIndex=5\nlog4j.appender.stomp.append=true\nlog4j.appender.stomp.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\nlog4j.appender.stomp.layout.ConversionPattern=%d [%-15.15t] %-5p %-30.30c{1} - %m%n\nlog4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp=TRACE, stomp\nlog4j.additivity.org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp=false\n# Enable these two lines and disable the above two if you want the frame IO ONLY (e.g., no heart beat messages, inactivity monitor etc).\nlog4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.StompIO=TRACE, stomp\nlog4j.additivity.org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.StompIO=false\nAfter this, all your Stomp packets will be logged to the data/stomp.log\nJava API\nFrom ActiveMQ 5.2: there is a simple Java Stomp API distributed with ActiveMQ. Note that this API is provided purely for testing purposes and you should always consider using standard JMS API from Java instead of this one. The following code snippet provides a simple example of using this API:\nStompConnection connection = new StompConnection();\nconnection.open(\"localhost\", 61613);\nconnection.connect(\"system\", \"manager\");\nStompFrame connect = connection.receive();\nif(!connect.getAction().equals(Stomp.Responses.CONNECTED)) {\n    throw new Exception (\"Not connected\");\n}\nconnection.begin(\"tx1\");\nconnection.send(\"/queue/test\", \"message1\", \"tx1\", null);\nconnection.send(\"/queue/test\", \"message2\", \"tx1\", null);\nconnection.commit(\"tx1\");\nconnection.subscribe(\"/queue/test\", Subscribe.AckModeValues.CLIENT);\nconnection.begin(\"tx2\");\nStompFrame message = connection.receive();\nSystem.out.println(message.getBody());\nconnection.ack(message, \"tx2\");\nmessage = connection.receive();\nSystem.out.println(message.getBody());\nconnection.ack(message, \"tx2\");\nconnection.commit(\"tx2\");\nconnection.disconnect();\nThis example is part of the standard ActiveMQ distribution. You can run it from the ./example folder with:\nant stomp\nStomp Extensions for JMS Message Semantics\nNote that STOMP is designed to be as simple as possible - so any scripting language/platform can message any other with minimal effort. STOMP allows pluggable headers on each request such as sending & receiving messages. ActiveMQ has several extensions to the Stomp protocol, so that JMS semantics can be supported by Stomp clients. An OpenWire JMS producer can send messages to a Stomp consumer, and a Stomp producer can send messages to an OpenWire JMS consumer. And Stomp to Stomp configurations, can use the richer JMS message control.\nSTOMP supports the following standard JMS properties on SENT messages:\nSTOMP Header\nJMS Header\nDescription\ncorrelation-id\nJMSCorrelationID\nGood consumers will add this header to any responses they send.\nexpires\nJMSExpiration\nExpiration time of the message.\nJMSXGroupID\nJMSXGroupID\nSpecifies the Message Groups.\nJMSXGroupSeq\nJMSXGroupSeq\nOptional header that specifies the sequence number in the Message Groups.\npersistent\nJMSDeliveryMode\nWhether or not the message is persistent.\npriority\nJMSPriority\nPriority on the message.\nreply-to\nJMSReplyTo\nDestination you should send replies to.\ntype\nJMSType\nType of the message.\nActiveMQ Extensions to STOMP\nYou can add custom headers to STOMP commands to configure the ActiveMQ protocol. Here are some examples:\nVerb\nHeader\nType\nDescription\nCONNECT\nclient-id\nstring\nSpecifies the JMS clientID which is used in combination with the activemq.subcriptionName to denote a durable subscriber.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.dispatchAsync\nboolean\nShould messages be dispatched synchronously or asynchronously from the producer thread for non-durable topics in the broker?\nFor fast consumers set this to false.\nFor slow consumers set it to true so that dispatching will not block fast consumers.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.exclusive\nboolean\nI would like to be an Exclusive Consumer on the queue.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.maximumPendingMessageLimit\nint\nFor Slow Consumer Handling on non-durable topics by dropping old messages - we can set a maximum-pending limit, such that once a slow consumer backs up to this high water mark we begin to discard old messages.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.noLocal\nboolean\nSpecifies whether or not locally sent messages should be ignored for subscriptions.\nSet to true to filter out locally sent messages.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.prefetchSize\nint\nSpecifies the maximum number of pending messages that will be dispatched to the client. Once this maximum is reached no more messages are dispatched until the client acknowledges a message.\nSet to a low value > 1 for fair distribution of messages across consumers when processing messages can be slow\nNote: if your STOMP client is implemented using a dynamic scripting language like Ruby, say, then this parameter must be set to 1 as there is no notion of a client-side message size to be sized.\nSTOMP does not support a value of 0.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.priority\nbyte\nSets the priority of the consumer so that dispatching can be weighted in priority order.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.retroactive\nboolean\nFor non-durable topics make this subscription retroactive.\nSUBSCRIBE\nactivemq.subscriptionName\nstring\nFor durable topic subscriptions you must specify the same activemq.client-id on the connection and activemq.subcriptionName on the subscribe prior to v5.7.0.\nNote: the spelling subcriptionName NOT subscriptionName. This is not intuitive, but it is how it is implemented in ActiveMQ 4.x.\nFor the 5.0 release of ActiveMQ, both subcriptionName and subscriptionName will be supported (subcriptionName was removed as of v5.6.0).\nSUBSCRIBE\nselector\nstring\nSpecifies a JMS Selector using SQL 92 syntax as specified in the JMS 1.1 specification. This allows a filter to be applied to each message as part of the subscription.\n"},"Connectivity/Containers/tomcat.html":{"url":"Connectivity/Containers/tomcat.html","title":"Tomcat","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Tomcat \nConnectivity > Containers > Tomcat\nConfiguration issues for Tomcat 7 and later\nTomcat needs to be configured to ignore Jetty SCI annotations so that the Jetty WebSocket ServerContainerInitializer class is not inadvertently picked up by Tomcat.

The stack supports injection of Topic, Queue and ConnectionFactory references as well as transactional sending and delivery.\nSomething like the following works out of the box with no configuration:\nimport javax.annotation.Resource;\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\nimport javax.jms.Topic;\nimport javax.jms.Queue;\nimport javax.jms.ConnectionFactory;\npublic class MyServet extends HttpServlet {\n@Resource(name = \"foo\")\nprivate Topic fooTopic;\n\n@Resource(name = \"bar\")\nprivate Queue barQueue;\n\n@Resource\nprivate ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;\nManually integrating Tomcat and ActiveMQ\nNote, manually integrating ActiveMQ with Tomcat does allow for Topic, Queue, and ConnectionFactory injection but does not support transactional sending and delivery.\nYou should go to Tomcat documentation and read JNDI Resources HOW-TO, especially part: Configure Tomcat's Resource Factory.\nActiveMQ has ready JNDI resource factory for all its administered objects: ConnectionFactory and destinations.\nYou must provide it as a parameter factory for your resources:\n\n  ...\n  \n  \n    \n      factory\n      org.activemq.jndi.JNDIReferenceFactory\n    \n    \n      brokerURL\n      vm://localhost\n    \n    \n      brokerName\n      LocalActiveMQBroker\n    \n    \n      useEmbeddedBroker\n      true\n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nIf you are using Tomcat 5.5 or later then try this instead...\n\n    ...\n  \n    ....\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to put ActiveMQ and dependent jars to tomcat shared lib directory.\nCreating destinations in Tomcat 5.5 or later\nThis is completely untested but should work \n\n    ...\n  \n\n  \n    ....\n\n\nJMX Tip when working with Tomcat\nIf you want to use JMX with Tomcat and then connect via JConsole to view the JMX MBeans of the server then set the following\nCATALINA_OPTS=\"$CATALINA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 \\\n    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false\"\n"},"Features/Unix/unix-service.html":{"url":"Features/Unix/unix-service.html","title":"Unix Service","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Unix Service \nFeatures > Unix > Unix Service\nThis page contained a very basic procedure to create a unix service for activemq.\nDue to the fact that ActiveMQ contains a very functional init script - this is not needed anymore.\nReview the documentation of the init script: Unix Shell Script\n"},"Connectivity/Protocols/xmpp.html":{"url":"Connectivity/Protocols/xmpp.html","title":"XMPP","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- XMPP \nConnectivity > Protocols > XMPP\nXMPP Protocol Support (Jabber!)\nDeprecated\nThis transport was deprecated in 5.8.0 and has been removed in a 5.9.0!\nWe have support for XMPP (Jabber) as a transport in ActiveMQ.\nTo use just add a connector as follows\n\n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\nAnd you can now use XMPP to connect to the broker & send and receive messages.\nSome versions of the broker (5.0-5.2) does not include WoodStox library by default, which could impact ActiveMQ XMPP funcionality. You should have a library named like wstx-asl-x.x.x.jar in the lib/optional directory of your broker. If that's not the case, download it from here and put it in the classpath\nXMPP Support in Apache ActiveMQ\nActiveMQ provides a bidirectional bridge between ActiveMQ messages and XMPP.\n\nif a client joins a chatroom / conference room, the name of the conference room is mapped to a JMS topic of the same name\ntyping into a chatroom sends a message to the topic\npresence in a chatroom maintains a subscription on the JMS topic (using noLocal to avoid getting copies of things you say) so that messages sent by other clients (via XMPP, the Web Console, the Examples or any other Cross Language Clients) are then sent to the chatroom.\n\nUsing a Jabber Client\nBasically, you should be able to connect from any Jabber-compatible client to the broker. The below example is using Spark 2.0.0 version. For more details on connecting with different clients take a look at #Jabber clients compatibility.\nTo connect to Apache ActiveMQ try the following...\n1. Run the Web Console2. Start Spark or whatever Jabber Client you wish3. Login to localhost:61222\nSome Jabber clients (like iChat) insist on usernames in forms of username@host, so in that case just append @localhost to your username\n\nSome Jabber clients like to auto-discover the host and port. You need to explicitly disable this feature so you can explicitly configure localhost as the host and 61222 as the port.\ne.g. on Spark go to the Advanced tab and disable the Automatically discover host and port\n4. You should now see the following screen...\n\n5. Now click on the Join Conference Room button (next to the Add Contact button) and the following dialog should appear\n\n6. Now press the Create or Join Room button to get the following dialog. Enter a JMS topic name, in this case foo.bar and you're good to go...\n\n7. Now your chat window should appear for talking and listening to the topic foo.bar. So start typing to test things out. \n\n 8. Now if you go to the Topic Console in the Web Console you should see the topic has been created\n \n9. If you now click on the Send To link next to the foo.bar topic you can send a message to the topic from the web console. \n \n10. Press send and you should see the chat appear on the chat window \n \nJabber clients compatibility\nHere you can find specfic issues and workarounds for various Jabber clients.

Often it makes sense to deploy a broker within your JVM. This allows you to optimise away a network hop; making the networking of JMS as efficient as pure RMI, but with all the usual JMS features of location independence, reliability, load balancing etc.\nThere are various ways to embed a broker in ActiveMQ depending on if you are using Java, Spring, XBean or using the ActiveMQConnectionFactory .\nUsing explicit Java code\nThe following Java code will create an embedded broker\nBrokerService broker = new BrokerService();\n// configure the broker\nbroker.addConnector(\"tcp://localhost:61616\");\nbroker.start();\nIf you want to lazily bind the transport connector as part of start(), useful when start() will block pending a store lock (as in a slave start), you can use the following code\nBrokerService broker = new BrokerService();\nTransportConnector connector = new TransportConnector();\nconnector.setUri(new URI(\"tcp://localhost:61616\"));\nbroker.addConnector(connector);\nbroker.start();\nIn the same JVM clients can then use the vm:// transport to connect to the embedded broker - whilst external clients can use the tcp:// protocol\nIf you have more than one embedded broker, ensure that you give them a unique name and - e.g.\nBrokerService broker = new BrokerService();\n// configure the broker\nbroker.setBrokerName(\"fred\");\nbroker.addConnector(\"tcp://localhost:61616\");\nbroker.start();\nThen if you want to connect to the broker named 'fred' from within the same JVM, you can by using the uri vm://fred\nIt is possible to fully configure a broker through application code e.g.\nBrokerService broker = new BrokerService();\nbroker.setBrokerName(\"fred\");\nbroker.setUseShutdownHook(false);\n//Add plugin\nbroker.setPlugins(new BrokerPlugin[]{new JaasAuthenticationPlugin()});\n//Add a network connection\nNetworkConnector connector = answer.addNetworkConnector(\"static://\"+\"tcp://somehost:61616\");\nconnector.setDuplex(true);\nbroker.addConnector(\"tcp://localhost:61616\");\nbroker.start();\nPlease note that you should add plugins before connectors or they will not be initialized\nFor more details on the available properties you can specify, see the BrokerService javadoc\nUsing the BrokerFactory\nThere is a helper class called BrokerFactory which can be used to create a broker via URI for configuration.\nBrokerService broker = BrokerFactory.createBroker(new URI(someURI));\nThe available values of the URI are\nURI scheme\nExample\nDescription\nxbean:\nxbean:activemq.xml\nSearches the classpath (and file system) for an XML document with the given URI (activemq.xml in this case) which will then be used as the Xml Configuration\nbroker:\nbroker:tcp://localhost:61616\nUses the Broker Configuration URI to confgure the broker\nUsing Spring\nThere is a factory bean that can refer to an external ActiveMQ XML configuration file\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nIn this case the usual Spring 'classpath:org/apache/activemq/xbean/activemq.xml' resource mechanism is being used so that the activemq.xml file would be found on the classpath by looking inside all the directories on the classpath then looking for 'org/apache/activemq/xbean/activemq.xml'. You can of course change this to any value you like. e.g. use classpath:activemq.xml if you just want to drop it in a directory that is in the classpath; like WEB-INF/classes in a web application.\nIf you wish you can use a URL instead using the file: or http: prefixes. For more details see how Spring deals with resources\nUsing XBean\nIf you are already using XBean then you can just mix and match your Spring/XBean XML configuration with ActiveMQ's configuration.\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\nUsing Spring 2.0\nIf you are using Spring 2.0 and ActiveMQ 4.1 or later (and xbean-spring 2.5 or later) you can embed the ActiveMQ broker XML inside any regular Spring.xml file without requiring the above factory bean. e.g. here is an example of a regular Spring XML file in Spring 2.0 which also configures a broker.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      10\n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nUsing ActiveMQConnectionFactory\nAn embedded broker can also be created using an ActiveMQConnectionFactory and using a vm connector as a uri. e.g.\nActiveMQConnectionFactory cf = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false\");\nUse the query parameters \"broker.\" to configure the broker, where  matches the bean properties on the BrokerService.\nThe broker will be created upon creation of the first connection.\nYou can turn off auto creation by setting the create property on the VM Transport to false:\nActiveMQConnectionFactory cf = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"vm://localhost?create=false\");\n"},"Community/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/activemq-command-line-tools-reference.html":{"url":"Community/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/activemq-command-line-tools-reference.html","title":"Command Line Tools","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- ActiveMQ Command Line Tools Reference \nCommunity > FAQ > Using Apache ActiveMQ > ActiveMQ Command Line Tools Reference\nCommand Line Tools\nThe current script contains the entire functionality to manage activemq.\n\nactivemq - runs an activemq broker(see Unix Shell Script)\n\nIn versions prior 5.4.1 some management functionalities beyond controlling the service itself where part of the \"activemq-admin\" script.This script is currently still part of the distribution to provide access to this for Windows users-\n\nactivemq-admin - manages a broker instance\n\nIn versions prior to 5.0 the functionality of activemq-admin script was scattered over multiple scripts, such as:\n\nshutdown - shutdowns an activemq broker\nlist - lists all running brokers in the specified JMX context\nquery - queries the JMX context for broker statistics and information\nbstat - predefined query that displays useful broker statistics\nbrowse - browse the messages of a specific queue\npurge - delete selected destination's messages that matches the message selector\n\nactivemq script  \n\nDescription of this script is valid for Windows platform.

Generally TCP or VM are the first transports you'll use.\nBe careful about whitespace\nAll of the following URI configurations are based on the java.net.URI class which does not allow whitespace to be used. So if you are using failover: or static: URIs, do not put any whitespace around the ',' symbol.\nThe AUTO Transport\nStarting with 5.13.0 ActiveMQ has support for automatic wire protocol detection over TCP, SSL, NIO, and NIO SSL.  OpenWire, STOMP, AMQP, and MQTT are supported.  For details see the AUTO Transport Reference.\nThe VM Transport\nThe VM transport allows clients to connect to each other inside the VM without the overhead of the network communication. The connection used is not that of a socket connection but instead uses direct method invocations to enable a high performance embedded messaging system.\nThe first client to use the VM connection will boot an embedded broker. Subsequent connections will attach that the same broker. Once all VM connections to the broker have been closed, the embedded broker will automatically shutdown.\nFor more information see the VM Transport Reference\nThe AMQP Transport\nAs of 5.8.0 ActiveMQ has support for AMQP. For details see the AMQP Transport Reference.\nThe MQTT Transport\nStarting with 5.6.0 ActiveMQ also supports MQTT. Its a light weight publish/subscribe messaging transport. See the MQTT Transport Reference for details.\nThe TCP Transport\nThe TCP transport allows clients to connect a remote ActiveMQ using a a TCP socket.\nFor more information see the TCP Transport Reference\nThe NIO Transport\nSame as the TCP transport, except that the New I/O (NIO) package is used, which may provide better performance. The Java NIO package should not be confused with IBM's AIO4J package.\nTo switch from TCP to NIO, simply change the scheme portion of the URI. Here's an example as defined within a broker's XML configuration file.\n\n  ...\n  \n      \n  \n  ...\n\n\nTrying to use nio transport url on the client side will instantiate the regular TCP transport. For more information see the NIO Transport Reference\nThe SSL Transport\nThis allows you to talk over TCP using SSL. For more information see the SSL Transport Reference\nThe NIO SSL Transport\nAvailability\nAvailable since 5.6\nImplementing SSL transport over NIO. This allows you to connect large number of SSL clients to a single broker instance. It's server side transport-option only\n\n  ...\n  \n      \n  \n  ...\n\n\nTrying to use nio+ssl transport url on the client side will instantiate the regular SSL transport.\nThe Peer Transport\nThe Peer transport provides a peer-to-peer network with ActiveMQ. What actually happens is the peer transport uses the VM transport to create and connect to a local embedded broker but which configures the embedded broker to establish network connections to other peer embedded brokers.\nFor more information see the Peer Transport Reference\nThe UDP Transport\nThis allows you to talk over UDP.\nFor more information see the UDP Transport Reference\nThe Multicast Transport\nThis allows you to talk over Multicast.\nFor more information see the Multicast Transport Reference\nThe HTTP and HTTPS Transport\nThis allows the ActiveMQ client and broker to tunnel over HTTP. If the client is not JMS you might want to look at REST or Ajax support instead.\nFor more information see the HTTP and HTTPs Transports Reference\nThe WebSockets Transport\nThis transport uses the new HTML5 WebSockets to exchange messages with the broker. For more information see the WebSockets Transport Reference\nThe Stomp Transport\nA plain text transport that can be used with many languages. See Stomp for more details.\nGeneral Purpose URIs\nYou can configure other features via the URI syntax as follows...\nConnection Configuration URI\nAny Apache ActiveMQ JMS connection can be configured using the URL or explicitly setting properties on the ActiveMQConnection or ActiveMQConnectionFactory objects themselves.\nFor more information see Connection Configuration URI\nDestination Options\nYou can configure various consumer related options using Destination Options which allow you to configure destinations using URI syntax.\nBroker Configuration URI\nYou can use a Broker Configuration URI to configure an embedded broker, either using the BrokerFactory helper class from Java or using the activemq shell script. For more details see How to Run a Broker\nConfiguring Wire Formats\nAny transport which involves marshalling messages onto some kind of network transport like TCP or UDP will typically use the OpenWire format. This is configurable to customize how things appear on the wire.\nFor more information see Configuring Wire Formats\nHigh Level Protocol URIs\nThe following higher level protocols can be configured via URI\nThe Failover Transport\nThe Failover transport layers reconnect logic on top of any of the other transports. This is what used to be the Reliable transport in ActiveMQ 3. Its configuration syntax allows you to specify any number of composite URIs. The Failover transport randomly chooses one of the composite URIs and attempts to establish a connection to it. If it does not succeed or if it subsequently fails, a new connection is established to one of the other URIs in the list.\nFor more information see the Failover Transport Reference\nThe Fanout Transport\nThe Fanout transport layers reconnect and replicate logic on top of any of the other transports. It is used replicate commands to multiple brokers.\nFor more information see the Fanout Transport Reference\nUsing Discovery\nOften when using transports like TCP you want to use Discovery to locate the available brokers. This is different from using, say, Multicast - as the actual main communication is over TCP but multicast is purely used to discover the location of brokers.\nThe Discovery Transport\nThe Discovery transport works just like the reliable transport, except that it uses a discovery agent to locate the list of URIs to connect to.\nFor more information see the Discovery Transport Reference\nThe ZeroConf Transport\nThe ZeroConf transport provides Discovery and it works like the Discovery Transport but rather than using our own multicast based discovery mechanism (which allows you to configure the exact multicast address and port, etc.), the ZeroConf transport is used instead.\nFor more information see the ZeroConf Transport Reference\nServer side options\nThere are a number of options that can be used for changing behavior on the server for the TransportConnector in the ActiveMQ broker configuration. These are:\nproperty name\ndefault\ndescription\nallowLinkStealing  \nfalse\nThis is enabled for default for MQTT transport.\nLink Stealing is where the last of two or more connections with the same id (clientID for JMS) is deemed the valid connection and the older one is closed by the broker.\ndiscoveryURI\nnull\nIf set, the multicast discovery address for client connections to find the broker.\nenableStatusMonitor\nfalse\nWill monitor connections to determine if they are blocked.\nname\nnull\nThe name of the TransportConnector instance.\nrebalanceClusterClients\nfalse\nWill automatically re-balance clients across the cluster on changes of topology.\nupdateClusterClients\nfalse\nIf enabled, will update client connections (if they use the failover:// transport) of changes to the broker cluster.\nupdateClusterClientsOnRemove\nfalse\nWill update clients if a broker is removed from the cluster.\nupdateClusterFilter\nnull\nComma separated list of regular expressions. Brokers with a name matching the pattern will be included for client updates.\nuri\nnull\nThe bind address for the transport.\nNote: properties in red are version 5.10 (and higher) options only.\nExample configuration:\n\n   \n\n   \n      \n   \n\n   \n\n\n"},"Community/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/how-can-i-monitor-activemq.html":{"url":"Community/FAQ/Using Apache ActiveMQ/how-can-i-monitor-activemq.html","title":"Monitoring the Broker","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- How can I monitor ActiveMQ \nCommunity > FAQ > Using Apache ActiveMQ > How can I monitor ActiveMQ\nHow can I monitor ActiveMQ\nStarting with ActiveMQ 5.8.0 Jolokia is bundled which provides a RESTful interface to ActiveMQ's JMX capabilities.

XML configurations, the XML validation is optional so you do not need to specify the XML Schema Locations. However if you are using Spring's 2.0 XML handling to parse the XML then you need to refer to the XSD locations in your XML document because Spring uses schema namespace or schema location to resolve namespace handlers. Without correct namespace definition you will get messages like below:\nUnable to locate NamespaceHandler for namespace [http://activemq.org/config/1.0\\]\nYou can refer to a specific version of the XSD in your XML as follows\n\n\nor if you prefer you can use a generic XSD without the version number\n\n\n\nYour IDE won't be able to fetch this XSD, you'll have to manually associate a specific release; however it does mean that you won't have to upgrade your XML config file with each ActiveMQ release; as it will resolve this XSD using the bundled XSD inside the activemq-core.jar.\n\n### Pay attention to the namespace\n\nIf you use ActiveMQ 5.0 or earlier you XML namespace definition should point to `[http://activemq.org/config/1.0](http://activemq.org/config/1.0)` . If you use ActiveMQ 5.1 or later the namespace should point to `[http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core](http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core)` .\n\n**ActiveMQ 5.2 example**\n\n\n\n\nActiveMQ 5.0 example\n\n\n\nBoth examples above are almost the same. Only one difference is xml namespace. You can find more information about the namespace change on activemq-dev topic: ActiveMQ namespace change.\nSchema Validation\nNote: The xml configuration ordering constraint is removed in 5.6, the broker element\nAlphabetically Ordered XML Elements (5.4 - 5.5.1)\nXMLSchema:sequence is replaced with an XMLSchema:all\nNote: from version 5.4.2, you can disable validation from the command line by appending a query parameter to the xbean url. This will allow you to reuse your existing xml configuration 'as is' if needed.\nbin/activemq console xbean:conf/activemq.xml?validate=false\nBeginning in ActiveMQ 5.4, the XML elements inside the  element must be ordered alphabetically. If you look at the XSD, this has always been the case with ActiveMQ. The difference in 5.4 is that the XML configuration is actually being validated against the XML schema.\nFor example, the following XML configuration did not present a problem in ActiveMQ 5.3.x:\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \" producerFlowControl=\"true\" memoryLimit=\"5mb\">\n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\nHowever, in ActiveMQ 5.4, the XML configuration above would cause an exception similar to the following:\nCaused by: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'persistenceAdapter'. One of '{\"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":producerSystemUsage, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":proxyConnectors, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":regionBroker, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":services, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":shutdownHooks, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":sslContext, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":systemUsage, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":taskRunnerFactory, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":tempDataStore, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":transportConnectorURIs, \"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\":transportConnectors, WC\"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\"}' is expected.\nTo avoid this XML validation error in ActiveMQ 5.4, simply change the ordering of the XML elements so that they are in alphabetical order. Below is an example of the same XML configuration but in alphabetical order:\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \" producerFlowControl=\"true\" memoryLimit=\"5mb\">\n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\nConfigurations can be easily tested against ActiveMQ 5.4 using the ActiveMQ startup script.

The fifth destination will not be used.\n'divide' - Clients will divide the destinations among themselves regardless of equality. i.e. if there are 2 producers and 5 destinations, producer 1 will send to 3 destinations, while producer 2 will send to 2 destinations.\n\nsysTest.reportDir\n./\nThe directory where the sampler report will be saved.\nsysTest.reportName\nnull\nThe default filename the sampler report will be saved us. There is usually no need to set this setting as the default value will create either JmsProducernumClients#_numDests#.xml and JmsConsumer_numClients#_numDests#_.xml, where # represents the number of clients and destinations set for that system, and  specifies the destination distribution for the system.\nsysTest.reportType\nxml\nSpecifies the manner of generating the performance report.

The file needs to be a text file. The entire content of the file will be sent as message body. Specifying a file containing the message to be sent makes the producer ignore the property producer.messageSize. Use relative or full path. Example: -Dproducer.msgFileName=../message.xml\nproducer.createNewMsg\nfalse\nIf true, each send will create a new JMS Message with the specified message size with incrementing text messages (i.e. Text Message 1, Text Message 2, ...).

Default values are based from the default values of the service provider org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory.\nActiveMQClassLoaderSPI loads from the classpath \"org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory\" and configures it using reflection. Configuration is generally based on the API of the class loaded. General format is factory.YYY or factory.XXX.YYY, where the last variable (YYY) is the property to set and everything in between is the getter of the class to use to set (YYY). For example:\n\nTo set the value for asyncSend in ActiveMQConnectionFactory, use:factory.useAsyncSend=true, which is equivalent to calling factory.setUseAsyncSend(true)\n\nTo set the queue prefetch for ActiveMQConnectionFactory, use:factory.prefetchPolicy.queuePrefetch=1, which is equivalent to calling factory.getPrefetchPolicy().setQueuePrefetch(1)\n\n\nIt should be noted that the loaded class should implement the appropriate getter and setter methods. Nested objects should also be properly instantiated. For more information on configuring this SPI, refer to the specific provider API manual.\nAs of ActiveMQ 4.0.1, these are the available fields and default values:\nConfiguration Key\nDefault Value\nfactory.prefetchPolicy.optimizeDurableTopicPrefetch\n1000\nfactory.prefetchPolicy.durableTopicPrefetch\n100\nfactory.password\nnull\nfactory.prefetchPolicy.queueBrowserPrefetch\n500\nfactory.useCompression\nfalse\nfactory.disableTimeStampsByDefault\nfalse\nfactory.optimizedMessageDispatch\ntrue\nfactory.useRetroactiveConsumer\nfalse\nfactory.alwaysSessionAsync\ntrue\nfactory.copyMessageOnSend\ntrue\nfactory.prefetchPolicy.topicPrefetch\n32766\nfactory.useAsyncSend\nfalse\nfactory.redeliveryPolicy.backOffMultiplier\n5\nfactory.prefetchPolicy.inputStreamPrefetch\n100\nfactory.closeTimeout\n15000\nfactory.userName\nnull\nfactory.optimizeAcknowledge\nfalse\nfactory.clientID\nnull\nfactory.objectMessageSerializationDefered\nfalse\nfactory.asyncDispatch\nfalse\nfactory.redeliveryPolicy.initialRedeliveryDelay\n1000\nfactory.prefetchPolicy.queuePrefetch\n1000\nfactory.redeliveryPolicy.maximumRedeliveries\n5\nfactory.redeliveryPolicy.useCollisionAvoidance\nfalse\nfactory.prefetchPolicy.maximumPendingMessageLimit\n0\nfactory.redeliveryPolicy.useExponentialBackOff\nfalse\nConfiguration for samplers\nThere are two samplers built into the perfomance test tool. Both are configured with the same configuration keys, only prefixed with different sampler names.\nSampler\nsamplerName\nThroughput Sampler\ntpSampler\nCPU Sampler\ncpuSampler\nFor example, it is possible to configure the two samplers differently for a single test run, using the prefixes above as follows:\nmvn activemq-perf:producer -DtpSampler.duration=10000 -DcpuSampler.duration=15000\nBy default, both samplers are used within a test run. This however, can be overridden through the use of the sysTest.samplers property.\nBefore ActiveMQ 5.11\nSampler configurations are not tied in to the test run, so it is possible for the sampler to run for longer than the actual test itself. For short run durations, the sampler may not even have ramped up before the test completes.\nConfiguration Key\nDefault Value\nDescription\nsamplerName.duration\n300000\nThe total duration (in ms) the sampler will run, including ramp up and ramp down time.\nsamplerName.rampUpTime\n30000\nThe ramp up time of the sampler, sampling will only start after the ramp up time.\nsamplerName.rampDownTime\n30000\nThe ramp down time of the sampler, sampling will stop when the sampler has executed for (duration - rampUpTime - rampDownTime) ms.\nsamplerName.interval\n1000\nThe interval (in ms), the sampler will sample for data.\nFrom ActiveMQ 5.11\nSampler run duration is tied directly to the behavior of the client (producer/consumer). Due to the non-deterministic nature of count-based tests (where consumer.recvType or producer.sendType are set to count), duration, ramp up and ramp down times are ignored; the samplers are shut down when the client completes.\nConfiguration Key\nDefault Value\nDescription\nsamplerName.duration\nFor time-based tests, matches the consumer or producer duration.\nIgnored for count-based tests.\nThe total duration (in ms) the sampler will run, including ramp up and ramp down time.\nsamplerName.rampUpTime\nnull; defers to rampUpPercent.\nIgnored for count-based tests.\nThe ramp up time of the sampler, sampling will only start after the ramp up time.\nsamplerName.rampDownTime\nnull; defers to rampDownPercent.\nIgnored for count-based tests.\nThe ramp down time of the sampler, sampling will stop when the sampler has executed for (duration - rampUpTime - rampDownTime) ms.\nsamplerName.rampUpPercent\n0\nIgnored for count-based tests.\nThe percentage of the overall run duration that the sampler should use to ramp up (0-100). Overridden by rampUpTime.\nsamplerName.rampDownPercent\n0\nIgnored for count-based tests.\nThe percentage of the overall run duration that the sampler should use to ramp down (0-99). Overridden by rampDownTime.\nsamplerName.interval\n1000\nThe interval (in ms), the sampler will sample for data.\nThe time taken to ramp up and ramp down, whether defined through milliseconds or as a percentage cannot exceed the total duration.\n"},"Developers/source.html":{"url":"Developers/source.html","title":"Source","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Source \nDevelopers > Source\nActiveMQ 5\nWeb Browsing of the git Repo\nTo browse via the web:\nhttps://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git\nChecking out from the git Repo\ngit clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq.git\nOnly project developers can commit to the git repo via this method.

A TransportChannel typically deals with some kind of networking mechanism (TCP sockets using BIO, using NIO, UDP / multicast, SSL over sockets, JXTA, EmberIO etc). See the org.apache.activemq.transport package for more details\nSo the TransportChannel is basically concerned with sending and receiving Command objects (each instance represents some kind of command). Packet is defined in the org.apache.activemq.command package which defines all the JMS Message implementations classes (which are Commands) along with a number of other kinds of packets, like subsciptions, message acknowledgements, transactions and so forth.\nWireFormat\nThere are various possible ways of encoding messages onto a stream. We may wish to adapt to various different encoding mechanisms - such as to provide simpler wire formats for talking to C / JavaScript or to make a C# friendly encoding.\nSo all the Transport  implementations take a pluggable WireFormat implementation class - which is a Strategy Pattern for deciding how to write the Command to a DataIn / DataOut stream or Datagram.\nSo if you wish to provide your own binary, on the wire protocol then we just need a WireFormat implementation of your protocol, then we can use this with any transport (TCP BIO, NIO, JXTA etc).\nWe use OpenWireFormat by default which is the most efficient & easiest format to use from Java code - so if both ends of the wire are Java then its highly recommended. Though other WireFormats are most welcome.\nDefault Wire Format\nThe default wire format writes a byte which indicates the kind of Command which is being sent (see the CommandTypes interface which defines all the int constants for each type of command.\nThe core JMS Message types each have a unique byte ID for\n\nMessage\nObjectMessage\nTextMessage\nMapMessage\nBytesMessage\nStreamMessage\n\nThen in addition there are various other types of command such as\n\nConnectionInfo for when a new connection is established with a message broker\nConsumerInfo when a new consumer is created on a connection\nMessageAck to acknowledge a message ID\nTransactionInfo to denote a transaction\n\nThere are a few others; the org.apache.activemq.command package describes them in their gory detail.\nBasically the DefaultWireFormat has a default encoding of each of these commands. So after the first byte which indicates the type of packet is written, there is a specific wire format per packet type.\nFor new wire formats it may be that you only need to support a small subset of these types. e.g. you might just have a simple publish message, consume message & message ack.\nMessage Broker\nThe APIs for the message broker (server side of the JMS client) are defined in the org.apache.activemq.broker. There are various other packages which define different parts, from the message stores to the message routing and so forth.\nTo see an overview of these packages try the JavaDocs\n\nActiveMQ System Overview\nIntroduction\nActiveMQ is the system responsible for creating and managing network connections used for communication between clients and the broker. This document hopes to outline the inner workings of this system with in order to make it easier to understand for future developers. It will give a high-level overview of the system and outline the major players. We will also cover a few other interesting classes that may be useful to others working on the system. Most of this document is written with the server side code in mind. This is because the client-side communication systems are architecturally simple and understanding the server will make understanding clients trivial by comparison.\nWe assume the reader has basic understanding of JMS. Refer to the official Java docs for more information.\nOverview: The Big Players\nThe core classes involved in the ActiveMQ communication system are Transports. These include the Transport, TransportServer, and TransportFactory hierarchies. Transports and TransportServers are wrappers around sockets and server sockets respectively. TransportFactorys (as you may have guessed) are factories that create Transports and TransportServers. Transports are connected to Brokers and transmit Commands, which represent all major actions to be taken by ActiveMQ (more on this later). The following example illustrates how these pieces fit together.\nThe primary class needed to create a JMS \"provider\" application is the Broker class. The default ActiveMQ binary will use a BrokerService class to wrap around Brokers. When the application is started, it instantiates a BrokerService and instructs it to bind to a specific (local) address, say \"tcp://localhost:61616\". The Broker will use the scheme in the given address and find the proper TransportFactory, TcpTransportFactory in this example. This factory will then be used to create a TcpTransportServer that will be bound to \"localhost:61616\". Once the TransportServer is started, it will continually pole its socket for incoming connections. Successfully connected incoming sockets will be wrapped in a TcpTransport instance and passed back (indirectly) to the Broker. The Broker will then start polling the new Transport for incoming Commands to process.\nThe final pieces missing from the above example are the TransportConnection and TransportConnector classes. These classes are used to connect Brokers to Transports and TransportServers respectively.\nClass Details\nThis section will explain some of the more interesting details of the mentioned classes separately.\nTransports, TransportServers, and TransportFactories\nThe basic principles of how these classes operate are very simple: Transports and TransportServers are wrappers around sockets and server sockets used to hide implementation, and TransportFactorys are factory classes for the mentioned classes. The only caveats are how TransportFactorys are chosen and configured based on URIs they are supplied.\nThe TransportFactory class is abstract and incapable of creating Transport or TransportServer classes directly. It, nevertheless, is the class used to create Transports and TransportServers. TransportFactory delegates its responsibilities to its subclasses based on the choice of subclass provided by the FactoryFinder class, which uses the URI's scheme to find a matching factory classes based on text files stored under the META-INF directory.\nConfiguration of the created Transports is done entirely to reflection. Transports are configured through calls to compositeConfigure, which are made by the factory at the time of the Transport's creation. compositeConfigure uses the IntrospectionSupport class to call setters for parameters passed in through the URI. For example, creating a Transport using the URI \"ssl://localhost:61616/?needClientAuth=true\" would result in the creation of an SslTransport object whose setNeedClientAuth method (if it exists) is called with the value of true immediately after its creation. TransportServers operate in a similar fashion. The only difference is that the call to IntrospectionSupport is made from the doBind method of the TransportFactory.\nCommands\nCommands are the main means for communication within Brokers. Each Command represents an action to be taken. Command subclasses include ConnectionInfo, KeepAliveInfo, and Message, which result in processing of new connections, maintenance of old connections, and processing of user messages respectively. These classes are de-serialized from Transports using Marshalers. Whenever new data is found in a socket, the first byte is read to determine what type of Command being received. The proper Marshaller is then selected to de-serialize the Command (e.g. to de-serialize a ConnectionInfo, the ConnectionInfoMarshaller is used).\nTransportConnections and TransportConnectors\nEvery TransportServer is connected to a Broker using a TransportConnector. The server's accept listener (which is called when a new Transport is constructed) is set to call the given TransportConnector's createConnection method with the new Transport. When called, createConnection creates a new TransportConnection that links the given Transport and the supporting Broker together; the Transport's transport listener is set to the TransportConnection's onCommand method, which is then called whenever a new Command is received.\nCommands and AbstractConnection (the superclass of TransportConnection) form a visitor pattern. onCommand will call AbstractConnection's service method which will make a series of calls in line with the visitor patter and eventually, the proper Command subclass to be passed to the corresponding method of the Broker for processing.\nBrokerFilters and BrokerPlugins\nWhile not used directly by the communication system, BrokerFilters and BrokerPlugins provide an effective and easy to use way of modifying Broker behavior. BrokerFilters allow for one to modify a few Broker methods without touching the rest (as the name suggests). The BrokerFilter passes on all of its responsibilities to a Broker it receives in its constructor. Subclassing BrokerFilter allows us to perform additional actions before passing the work down to the underlying Broker.\nThe power of the BrokerFilter class comes from the fact that multiple filters can be cascaded to create different functional combinations. As an example, the JaasAuthenticationBroker is a subclass of BrokerFilter that modifies the methods used for adding and removing connections to allow for JAAS authentication. AuthorizationBroker is another subclass of BrokerFilter. This class modifies the destination regulation methods to enforce access levels. With this architecture, one can create a JaasAuthenticationBroker and have it use an AuthorizationBroker as its underlying broker (which would use another broker itself, etc.).\nBrokerPlugins are simple classes that will wrap their corresponding Brokers around the one they are given. i.e. \"installing\" an AuthorizationPlugin on an existing Broker will create an AuthorizationBroker that uses the original Broker internally. The main reason for the existence of BrokerPlugins is to allow for one to configure the Broker used by the BrokerService class (either through code or XML configuration and spring).\n"},"Developers/wire-protocol.html":{"url":"Developers/wire-protocol.html","title":"Wire Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Wire Protocol \nDevelopers > Wire Protocol\nThis page describes the logical OpenWire protocol for users developing clients in other languages than Java such as C# or C native clients. Note that OpenWire is designed for maximum performance and features; its the protocol used inside ActiveMQ. If you want a simpler protocol to work with to get started with a cross language client then try Stomp which is designed for ease-of-implementation so its easy to support many clients.\nProtocol overview\nA client of ActiveMQ will exchange Command objects (following the Command Pattern). We'll describe how these commands are exchanged...\nThe protocol uses mostly one way messaging (fire and forget) for most kinds of commands - but there are times when RPCs (request, response) messaging is used. We'll indiciate the RPC scenarios clearly.\nEstablishing connections\nThe client must send a ConnectionInfo command with details of the machine, host name, user name, password and most importantly the unique clientId the client wishes to use and then wait for a valid Response before continuing. The clientId must be generated using a unique string generator.\nSending messages\nOnce you've established a connection, you need to create a logical MessageProducer. This involves sending a ProducerInfo command with a unique producerId, sessionId and the clientId (connection ID).\nFrom that point on you can send a Message command any time you like, provided you adorn the message with the clientId, sessionId, producerId along with a transactionId if required (see below on transactions).\nConsuming messages\nCommands are delivered on your inbound socket for consumption. Some of these will be Responses of previous RPCs, the rest will be incoming Messages for dispatch.\nTo start consuming messages you must send a ConsumerInfo command with details of the clientId, sessionId and a unique consumerId. From this point on you will receive inbound messages which contain the consumerId for which they are destined for.\nTo acknowledge a message send a MessageAck to the server (one way). Fill in the MessageAck with details of the consumerId, sessionId, clientId and any transactionIds.\nWorking with Responses\nWhen you create a connection, a producer and a consumer you will receive a Response to indicate the status of the request (such as did it work or fail). Since the protocol is asynchronous you can receive Response commands out of order; you could have multiple threads using the same connection/socket sending commands in parallel.\nSo its usual in multi-threaded clients to have some kind of correlation Map to match Command ids with Response Ids so that you can know which operation in what thread worked or failed etc. See the Transport implementations in Java to see how we do that. e.g. see ResponseCorrelator\nIDs\nIt is currently a requirement of the client to automatically generate client, session, producer and consumer IDs which are typically Strings and indended to be globally unique. Similarly each Command has its own integer counter ID which is used for the client to correlate requests to responses; the client will typically use an incrementing rolling counter for these.\nClosing producers, consumers, sessions, connections\nTo close a resource send a RemoveInfo command with the correct objectId for the producer, consumer, session, connection etc.\nJMS Transactions\nEach transacted session generates a unique transaction ID which is passed along on any transaction message. To start, commit or rollback the client should send a TransactionInfo command oneway (no Response is generated).\nAfter a commit or rollback a new transaction ID should be generated and a new start TransactionInfo sent.\nAny messages sent or message acknowledgements made should also propogate the transaction Id.\nXA Transactions\nAs above but using the XATransactionInfo. Also we pass an XAid rather than a transactionID.\nFinal thoughts\nIf in doubt about a piece of the protocol, the easiest way to figure out what happens is to check the JMS client code. In particular check out the code of ActiveMQSession which contains pretty much all the above logic. Pay particular attention to calls to syncSendCommand() and asyncSendCommand() when Commands are sent to the Message Broker\n"},"Developers/release-guide.html":{"url":"Developers/release-guide.html","title":"Release Guide","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Release Guide \nDevelopers > Release Guide\nHow to create and announce an ActiveMQ release. This release is based on General guide for releasing Maven-based project at Apache , so be sure to check it out before continuing and meet all prerequisites.\nMaven 2 Setup\nBefore you deploy anything to the maven repository using Maven 2, you should configure your ~/.m2/settings.xml fileso that the file permissions of the deployed artifacts are group writeable. If you do not do this, other developers will not able to overwrite your SNAPSHOT releases with newer versions.\n\n  ...\n  \n\n    \n      apache.snapshots.https\n      dejanb\n    \n    \n    \n      apache.website\n      dejanb\n      664\n      775\n    \n    \n    \n      apache.releases.https\n      dejanb\n    \n    \n    \n      stagingSite \n      dejanb\n      664\n      775\n    \n\n  \n  ...\n\n\nIt is also essential that you configure your umask to 2 on people.apache.org for non-interactive login. If your shell is tcsh you can edit .cshrc to include\numask 2\nOther shell initialization files may interfere with this setting but if this is the only umask setting it appears to work. Instructions for other shells would be welcome.\nAdditional local configuration for using release and staging plugins.\nTo effectively use the release and staging plugins you need some information about where the staging will happen and signing information for gpg. Your ~/.m2/settings.xml should contain a profile like this:\n\n    \n        \n          apache-release\n          \n             secretPhrase\n         \n        \n    \n ...\n\n\nCreating the ActiveMQ Release\nThe release plugin will prompt for a release version, tag and next release version. Use a three digit release version of the form: 5.x.x and for the tag use a string of the form: activemq-5.x.x. The next version string should use the two digit from: 5.x-SNAPSHOT as this can be consistent for future SNAPSHOT releases.\n\nVerify the to-be-released version identifier exists in the META-INF/spring.schemas mappings file AND activemq-osgi/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.schemas file, if not add it and commit. It should contain:\nhttp\\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-${pom.version}.xsd=activemq.xsd\n\nVerify headers with rat\nmvn -e apache-rat:check\ngrep -e ' !?????' target/rat.txt -- will show any files without licenses\n\nDo a release dry run to check for problems\nmvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true\nCheck that you are happy with the results. The poms for the proposed tags will be in pom.xml.tag. When you like the results, clean up:\nmvn release:clean\n\nPrepare the release\nmvn release:prepare\nThis will create the tag in git and leave various stuff around locally to direct the perform phase.\n\nMake a local copy of the release configuration in case something goes wrong\ncd ..\ncp -r activemq-release activemq-release-prepared\ncd activemq-release\n\nPerform the release to the staging repo\nmvn release:perform\nThis uses both the activemq release profile which directs building source jars, javadoc jars, and signing everything, and also the settings release profile that says where toput stuff and how to sign it.\n\nClose the staging repositoryQuote from the Maven release guide for Apache projects\n\nLogin to https://repository.apache.org using your Apache LDAP credentials. Click on \"Staging\". Then click on \"maven\" in the list of repositories. In the panel below you should see an open repository that is linked to your username and ip. Right click on this repository and select \"Close\". This will close the repository from future deployments and make it available for others to view. If you are staging multiple releases together, skip this step until you have staged everything. Enter the name and version of the artifact being released in the \"Description\" field and then click \"Close\". This will make it easier to identify it later.\n\nSee the image in the original guide for more info.\n\nVerify staged artifactsQuote from the original guide\n\nIf you click on your repository, a tree view will appear below. You can then browse the contents to ensure the artifacts are as you expect them. Pay particular attention to the existence of *.asc (signature) files. If the you don't like the content of the repository, right click your repository and choose \"Drop\". You can then rollback your release and repeat the process.Note the repository URL, you will need this in your vote email.\n\n\nBuild the site from the tag that release:perform checked out into target/checkout in the previous step.Note that the -Prelease profile is needed to specify the profile in settings.xml that configures the staging location.\ncd target/checkout\nmvn site -Prelease\n\nPopulate the Javadocs site in svn\nsvn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/activemq/content\ncd content/maven\nmkdir \ncopy over apidocs folder that was created by the site plugin to /apidocs\nsvn add \nsvn rm apidocs\nln -s /apidocs apidocs\nsvn add apidocs\n# and commit once it looks good.\n\nStage the official release artifacts in the SVN dist dev area for folks to test and vote on, using the helper script already in the repo:\nsvn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/activemq/activemq/\ncd activemq\n./prepare-release.sh  \n# Example: ./prepare-release.sh https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheactivemq-1149 5.15.1\nsvn add \nand commit once it looks good.\n\nCall a vote on the dev list, listing the great new features of the release.\n\n\nAfter the vote passes\n\nPromote the release (i.e. release the staging repository): login tohttps://repository.apache.org, navigate to the staging repository and click the \"release\" button. \nCopy the staged release files from the SVN dist dev folder to the SVN dist release folder: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/activemq/\nsvn cp -m \"add files for activemq-\" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/activemq/activemq/ https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/activemq/\n# Example: svn cp -m \"add files for activemq-5.15.1\" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/activemq/activemq/5.15.1 https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/activemq/5.15.1\n\nPopulate the schema site in svn\nsvn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/activemq/content\ncd content/schema/core\ncurl --remote-name-all https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/activemq/activemq-spring//activemq-spring-{-schema.html,.xsd}{.asc,.asc.md5,.asc.sha1,.sha1,.md5,}\nfor i in activemq-spring-5.9.0; do mv -- \"$i\" \"${i//spring/core}\"; done;\nsvn add activemq-core-5.9.0\nsvn rm activemq-core.xsd\nln -s activemq-core-5.9.0.xsd activemq-core.xsd\nsvn add activemq-core.xsd\n# and commit once it looks good.\n\nContinue with the Announcing section below\n\nCreated a in progress wiki page for the next release\nRemove any releases from the dist site that are no longer supported and update the wiki page for that release to point to the archives for downloads.\n\nAnnouncing the ActiveMQ Release\n\nPerform a release in JIRA and create a new release version in JIRA.\nMove unresolved issues to the next release first, in a bulk (do not send email) update\nYou might also want to search for resolved/closed issues with no fix version just in case\n\n\nCreate a download page for the release in the WIKI similar like the ActiveMQ 5.3.0 Release; also update the main Download page as appropriate\nUpdate the Xml Reference page with a link to the HTML and XSD\nUpdate latest release link on home page\nChange the links for the prior release to reference the archive (at http://archive.apache.org/dist/activemq/); otherwise, users will not be able to locate the older release for download\nUpdate QuickLinks and JavaDocs pages\nMail the dev & user lists\nPost a news entry on the WIKI\ntweet\nHave a beer! \n\n"},"Developers/benchmark-tests.html":{"url":"Developers/benchmark-tests.html","title":"Benchmark Tests","keywords":"","body":"Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- Benchmark Tests \nDevelopers > Benchmark Tests\nActiveMQ Maven Performance test plugin.\nStarting with ActiveMQ 5.5 and above the plugin can be obtained from maven or if you download the src from SVN you can build it yourself.
